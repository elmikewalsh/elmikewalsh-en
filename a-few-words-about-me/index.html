I would probably (unfortunately) end up using about 1000.</p><p>Born &amp; raised in Westmont, Illinois, (in the north-central part of the United States) for around the first 30 years or so of life. During this time, I went through the high school routine and passed through the university as well. During my university time I would learn a number of things, but two experiences in particular would shape the future</p><ol><li>I had the opportunity to spend 3 months in the south-central part of Chile, in a city called San Pedro de la Paz (Which is next to Concepción, an even larger city).</li><li>I discovered the computer lab in the basement of student housing.</li></ol><p>For real. I became fascinated with the World Wide Web. In the really early years - we're talking 1997 - I would go to the basement of student housing and search for "How to create a website" on the internet. Since I was a poor university student, the only hosting I could access was ...*gasp*... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoCities</a> (I hang my head in shame).</p><p>Little by little, as the years passed by, I became more adept at designing, and coding. Instead of hitting the bars, I was taking my first steps in learning CSS, HTML, PHP...</p><p>I also discovered that, once I learn how to do something, I enjoy explaining how it works to other people. This is where the "pedagogical love" part of my education comes in, I suppose.</p><p>Well, once the university part of life was over, it took a few years to figure out what (or where) I wanted to do this "life" thing. So I took the crazy decision to move to Chile.</p><hr><h3>The Southern Adventure</h3><p>The actual process of moving to Chile was looooong and involved sleeping (somewhat) in the Atlanta airport and the 14-hour flight with all my possessions. But once I arrived in Chile, things got better quickly. I started working in an institute in the city of Chillán, which connected me to many wonderful people (including my wife). And 2 years later our child was born! =)</p><p>A strange turn of events led me to start working with TeachingChile, the company that provided me a foothold in Chile. I began by working freelance on periodic website updates, while also working some freelance work on the side under the name <a href="https://www.imaginalgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaginalgo</a>. and joined the team at the start of 2012. This was my first taste of "remote work". At the same time I wrapped up work at a language institute in Valdivia - to present it has been the last job I was required to "go to".</p><hr><h3>Shift to Design</h3><p>I was soon sought out by another language institute which offered me the chance to teach classes via the internet - I continued with both of these remote jobs for the next several years. In 2017 I shifted gears and began working with <a href="http://www.optuno.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optuno</a> as a Web Designer and later as a Project Manager, which I continue to enjoy to the present.</p><hr><p>Looking to make contact?
