<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrr">Why Would I Bother?</h3>
<p>In 2024, using a password manager is super important – almost vital.  Since nearly everything is done online — from banking to bowel movements (well, not quite yet), social media and shopping — individuals are more exposed to potential data breaches than ever before. It's very important to <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/defending-your-cybercastle-digital-art-of-war/">defend your cybercastle</a> (pardon the ridiculous illustration) from people who like to stick their fingers where they don't belong.</p>
<p>Password managers offer a secure solution by generating complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts, reducing the risk of using easily guessed or reused passwords across multiple sites. This practice not only strengthens personal security but also shields against credential stuffing attacks, where hackers use compromised passwords from one site to access others (which is a complex way of saying that if hackers get your password from one data breach, they can try all your accounts, in case you use the same password everywhere).</p>
<p>As we open accounts and use services on more and more sites, maintaining a consistent level of security becomes challenging without a password manager. These tools not only store passwords securely but also simplify the login process across different devices, enhancing both convenience and security. By centralizing password management, users can focus on their activities online without the constant worry of remembering or securing multiple passwords manually.</p>
<p>I was, like you, hesitant to start, thinking that it would be difficult, complicated and a lot of work (and I like tech stuff). I went with <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a> because it had great reviews AND …..it was (and is) free. If you like this, you can <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/not-my-faultapp-default/">check out a list of other software / services I recommend</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrs">Getting Started with Bitwarden: Your First Password Manager</h3>
<p>Ok, so you’re considering setting up this complex and terrifying “password manager”.  Before we begin, it might help to simplify the idea of a “password manager” a bit. Imagine that over the course of your day you had to unlock 40 doors with physical keys. Each key if different. And good thing; if all 40 locks used the same key, you could imagine what would happen if you lost one, right?</p>
<p>Using the same password on your email, bank, social media, Netflix account, etc, is like using one physical key to open all your locks. Good luck to you if you lose your key or someone steals it to make themselves a copy.</p>
<p>What if you had a small piece of FREE software that you could use anywhere you went (your browser – you like Firefox? Prefer Safari?  Browse with Brave? Opera?  Chrome (ewwww) – this software is available for all those browsers. Doesn’t matter if you use Windows, Mac, even Linux. Android phone? Check. iPhone? Check.</p>
<p>Bitwarden is one such program. (there are others, but we’re looking at this one).</p>
<p>What if, using this FREE software, you could create just ONE safe complex password and only have to remember that one password. Because once you open your Bitwarden with that password, all your other passwords are safely waiting inside. And those passwords could be super safe and super long. (Maybe 30, 40, 60 characters long; a hideous mix of letters, numbers, capitalization, etc). You wouldn’t ever have to think of a new and safe password again, because the program automatically generates one for you.</p>
<p>Bitwarden does that. Interested? This takes a bit of time to set up, but once complete, you’re good to go. I took the leap. Take a little to get used to it.  But it’s soooooo much better.  Follow along:</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrt">Step 1: Visit the Bitwarden Website</h3>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden's official website</a>. You can poke around and learn about the product, the company, etc. But we’re here for the free software, so let’s continue….</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7olru">Step 2: Download the Software</h3>
<p>Once on the Bitwarden homepage, click on the “Download” button in the top navigation bar. You’ll be taken to a page with various download options. Bitwarden is available on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Choose the platform that suits your needs and follow the instructions to download the app.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re using Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the “Windows” icon.</li>
<li>The download will start automatically.</li>
<li>Once the download is complete, open the installer file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Bitwarden on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrv">Step 3: Create Your Account</h3>
<p>After installing Bitwarden, open the application. You’ll be prompted to create an account. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the “Create Account” button.</li>
<li>Fill in your email address, a strong master password, and your name. Make sure your master password is something you can remember but also something that’s hard for others to guess. Bitwarden will help you gauge the strength of your password.</li>
<li>Confirm your password and click “Submit”.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A super super important note at this step that I’ll repeat a few times – make sure your MASTER PASSWORD is something you will remember easily. Part of the reason Bitwarden is so secure is that they do not know your password. They don’t have access and they can’t send you a link to reset it. You can change the password later, but you will need to know the current password. Your master password cannot be recovered if you forget it! <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>So if you forget your MASTER PASSWORD, you’re screwed; you can’t get in, you can’t recover your password.</strong></span> Please make sure you choose a MASTER PASSWORD you will remember. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS STEP!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols0">Step 4: Verify Your Email</h3>
<p>Bitwarden will send a verification email to the address you provided. Check your inbox and click on the verification link in the email. This step is crucial for securing your account.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols1">Step 5: Log In and Set Up Your Vault</h3>
<p>With your account verified, log in to Bitwarden with your email and master password. You’ll now enter your vault, the secure place where all your passwords will be stored.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols2">Step 6: Add Your First Item</h3>
<p>To add your first password:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the “+” button or the “Add Item” button.</li>
<li>You’ll be prompted to enter the name of the item (e.g., Gmail, Facebook), the username, and the password. If you don’t have a strong password yet, Bitwarden can generate one for you. Just click on the “Generate” button and a strong, random password will be created.</li>
<li>Once you’ve filled in the details, click “Save”.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols3">Step 7: Organize Your Vault</h3>
<p>As you add more items, you might want to organize them into folders. This makes it easier to find specific passwords later on. To create a folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on “Folders” in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Click “Add Folder”.</li>
<li>Name your folder and click “Save”.</li>
<li>You can now move items into this folder by editing the item and selecting the folder from the dropdown menu.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols4">Step 8: Install Browser Extensions</h3>
<p>Bitwarden offers browser extensions for Chrome (ewww), Firefox, Safari, Edge, and more. These extensions allow you to autofill passwords directly from your vault, making logging in to websites a breeze.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go back to the Bitwarden download page and select your browser.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to add the extension.</li>
<li>Once installed, log in to the extension with your Bitwarden account.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols5">Step 9: Import Existing Passwords</h3>
<p>If you’ve been storing passwords in your browser or another password manager, you can import them into Bitwarden. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export your passwords from your current manager. This is usually found in the settings or options menu under “Export”.</li>
<li>In Bitwarden, click on “Tools” and then “Import Data”.</li>
<li>Select the format of your exported file and upload it to Bitwarden.</li>
<li>Click “Import” and all your passwords will be added to your vault.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols6">Step 10: Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>For an extra layer of security, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Bitwarden account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings” in your Bitwarden account.</li>
<li>Click on “Two-step Login”.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to set up 2FA using an app like Google Authenticator or Authy.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols7">Step 11: Sync Across Devices</h3>
<p>Make sure your passwords are available on all your devices. Install Bitwarden on your phone and log in with your account. Your vault will sync automatically, ensuring you have access to your passwords wherever you go.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols8">Step 12: Explore Advanced Features</h3>
<p>Bitwarden offers many advanced features such as secure notes, password sharing, and encrypted file storage. While these, and other paid offerings, are not at all necessary, you can certainly see if you like what they offer. If Bitwarden is not your cup of tea, I could also recommend <a href="https://proton.me/pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton Pass</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols9">You Did It!</h3>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve now set up Bitwarden, and can generate super long, secure passwords that are different for all your websites – and you only need to remember that one MASTER PASSWORD...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure your MASTER PASSWORD is something you will remember easily. Part of the reason Bitwarden is so secure is that they do not know your password. They don’t have access and they can’t send you a link to reset it. You can change the password later, but you will need to know the current password. Your master password cannot be recovered if you forget it! <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>So if you forget your MASTER PASSWORD, you’re screwed; you can’t get in, you can’t recover your password.</strong></span> Please make sure you choose a MASTER PASSWORD you will remember. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS STEP!</p>

                    <p><img src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/52/perplexing-copywrong.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Image of a faceless person holding a copyright symbol" /></p>
                <h3>Perplexity, copyrights and citing your work - the good ol' days</h3>
<p>AI is in the news. In daily conversations. In your social media feeds (if you do that still).  AI is the digital magic wand that will make all your dreams come true: construct your code, paint your pictures and write your articles.  Or, at least, in some cases it will write your articles. In other cases, it will simply steal them from people who already wrote them (do people still write things on the internet?)</p>
<h3>How Confusing: Perplexity</h3>
<p>In case you haven’t heard, the latest scandal involves the company Perplexity, which, in summary, was caught copying articles that were not theirs and not attributing the source of the articles. I won’t summarize, as the company is not worth the time. You can catch up on it here. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations</a></p>
<p>In summary, it is the digital equivalent of going to a store, shoplifting a product, changing the label, and selling it in your store.  Amazing business model! Why didn’t anyone think of that before.</p>
<h3>Old School Accreditation</h3>
<p>Being a bit older, I am reminded of famous musical acts such as Milli Vanilli (side note: tragic story. search for it on the internet. You might even find an original journalistic note, rather than regurgitated AI tripe). Or just click here - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli</a></p>
<p>Why is Milli Vanilli famous?  Mainly for supposedly singing when they weren’t.</p>
<p>Back in the day, claiming something was yours when it wasn’t was not well received.</p>
<p>Today, however, it is apparently a very successful business model.</p>
<p>I remember back in school if you turned in an assignment without attributing your sources, you received a 0.</p>
<p>Maybe that should remain the model to follow?</p>

<p>I spent 30 minutes Googling how to build homes in my sleep using the new GPT Hammer &amp; Nails, and sold them with just a few clicks on Instagram. The internet is full of opportunities. Just a quick search on Google will show you there are hundreds of results for a ton of people with the same three “make money in your sleep” ideas that have already saturated the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> If there are a ton of articles on how to do this, any real market is already saturated and you’re only going to compete for what little falls from the people who already set up those businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnm71plm">The Full Scoop</h3>
<p>Ok, for those of you who are curious and want to keep reading (didn’t stop above), I think many of us have considered it, especially in the post-pandemic economic inflation-ridden world that is 2023-2024:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can I set up a business quickly that makes, sells and ships products quickly and automatically, and I just receive the proceeds automatically in my bank account?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great, right?  Almost too good to be true.  If that message arrived in your email inbox, and you clicked the link provided - I sure hope you have a good antivirus program.</p>
<p>But seriously, since AI, ChatGPT, etc. is all the rage right now, I did a quick search for how to make $XYZ/month automatically using ChatGPT. Because…why not, right?</p>
<p>It seems that everyone has written an article about this amazing miracle, which seems to involve buying stock designs, having ChatGPT spit out silly messages, and automating t-shirt/product creation.  Then they just sell themselves, right?</p>
<p>I do ask myself, “Self, if everyone has economic issues at this point ….who the hell is buying this stuff?!?</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnm71pmn">The Full House</h3>
<p>Now, in theory, the articles describe an interesting process on how to make money. And, unless the authors just made it up (which is also possible), then it makes money for someone.</p>
<p>But, as is the case with anything “in”, once someone sees that XYZ is a success, then EVERYONE wants to do it.</p>
<p>And after everyone starts doing it, it is no longer “in”.  Because, c’mon ….everyone’s doing it.</p>
<p>So we will eventually be flooded with 1,000,000 online stores selling mugs and t-shirts with silly messages provided by GTP Chat.</p>
<p>It’s cool, everyone is doing it, so go follow the crowd.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnm71pmo">The Full Money</h3>
<p>Still, I suppose that most people will still want to find that magical easy way to make money with little to no effort. I suppose that there are ways to take Chat GPT (which is just a tool, by the way) and apply it to a <strong>new</strong> idea. If you are going to go this route, at least take a route that no one else is going.</p>
<p>I, for one, have applied ChatGPT to our toolbox and it now builds houses automatically. I’ve written a Python script to post the houses on the internet, so they just basically sell themselves.  :)</p>

</div>
<p>It’s 2024 - if you are still using a basic password like <em>password1234</em> (shame on you) or using the same password for all your online accounts, you are just begging for a world of digital (and real-life) hurt.</p>
<p>It can be a bit intimidating for people to start using a password manager, but put simply: would you prefer to take a bit of time now to set up a small program you can use for free and anywhere, so your passwords are safe, or are you the type that prefers to call banks in a rush to cancel cards, send support emails to companies explaining you were hacked while waiting impatiently for a reply?  If you are the first group - read on!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5313">Choose a free password manager</h3>
<p>First you need to choose one. There are all sorts of free and paid options, but there are two options that are more than enough for your needs, and both are free:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a></li>
<li><a href="https://proton.me/pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton Pass</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice is yours - I had access to Bitwarden first so mainly use that. The design is a bit dated. Proton Pass, on the other hand, is much nicer to look at, but not as mature a product as Bitwarden. Anyways, choose one and install. Then, the next step is the most important:</p>
<h3>Create a strong master password</h3>
<p>A good password manager will require you set up a master password, to access the password manager. A good password manager will also NOT store your master password. As a result, should you lose or forget it, you will not be able to retrieve it or request the company send it to you. You also will not be able to generate a new one. So THIS password is one that will have to be a good one and also one that you can remember. (This is the step that will burn you later on if you don’t think about it for just a bit).</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5315">Import existing passwords</h3>
<p>If you have passwords saved in your browser, many free password managers allow you to import them. This is a good idea and will save time. Go for it!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5316">Automatically store new passwords</h3>
<p>Let the password manager automatically store new passwords when you log in. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5317">Create New Passwords</h3>
<p>Use the Password Manager to manually generate new passwords and also check if your password is found in a data breach. Some password managers, like Bitwarden, will let you easily set a password length (40, 50, even 100 characters). These will be passwords that you are likely unable to ever memorize. However, it isn’t necessary - as long as you remember the master password you set up in step #2, you’ll have access to it.  It also doesn’t matter what browser you use, as there is an extension that you can install and use on your computer, phone, etc.</p>
<p>Quick easy steps. In 2024 there is no excuse for using a poor password. You can take a small amount of time now to peacefully set up a password manager…. or a lot more (and stressful) time later on.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/34/naming-game-2.webp" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Presenting yourself on the internet can be rather complicated. Especially when you add the factor of a multilanguage website.  Domain name availability, the ability to pronounce / spell a name are all factors.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve put what I believe to be the final touches (for now, at least) on my personal website setup.  Originally, I went with one domain name and a subdomain for English speakers. It looked something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>elmikewalsh.com</li>
<li>en.elmikewalsh.com</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all fine and well…. In an English-speaking setting. No one would have problems spelling “mike”, “Walsh” is tough to screw up, and despite “el” being from Spanish, most English speakers would get the idea.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a Spanish-speaking content, it’s not so easy. Here’s the pitfalls I experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mike:</strong>  In Chile at least, you get “Maik”, “Maikol" or “Mike”.  So there’s a 1 in 3 chance that part will be spelled correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Walsh:</strong> Spanish (and other Romance languages) have a nice flow of consonants and vowels.  My last name does not. So about 100% of the time it is reduced to spelling it out.</li>
<li><strong>El: </strong>No problems in Spanish land with this one.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So, having to spell out m-i-k-e-w-a-l-s-h to share my domain name or email address sucks.  Especially by phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good test for choosing your name/email/whatever btw - if you can say it in a phone conversation and the other person can note it, you’re doing well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Here’s how I got around it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I have two separate domain names  - it’s as short as possible and only the extensions are different.</li>
<li>For Spanish speakers (and a slight search results boost by using a ccTLD) I can be found at - <a href="https://www.elmike.cl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elmike.cl</a></li>
<li>For the English version of my personal site I went with - elmike.me (you are here)</li>
<li>For personal email I went with the .me version, since .me works well in Spanish as well.  It’s also easier to say, as “cl” is unpronounceable and you end up saying each letter.</li>
<li>Also by eliminating my last name, a Spanish-speaker is just left with “mike”.  For the Spanish-speaker (Chilean) that can’t spell it (quite a few it seems) I can say, “Mike. Mee-Kay-con-Ka) and that will work 99% of the time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And for the other 1% electronic communication might be a whole different issue.</p>
<hr>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elmikewalsh.com</a> domain?  I put together a neat starry night landing/splash page with two photos of myself linked to the Spanish and English versions of my personal sites.</p>
<p>And that’s all I have to say about that.</p>

                <p>Quentin Tarantino recently remarked that he plans to make 10 movies, and that’s it. (note: in context, he did indicate that he would be fine doing something later on despite having done 10 movies, so it’s not a set-in-stone number). Mentioned wanting to go out at the top of his game.  Similar to some, but not all, athletes.  The same applies to everything; our “mere mortal” projects. Our jobs. Our ambitions. Our desire to make more, have more, obtain more, visit more, watch more, see more.</p>
<p><strong>At what point is it enough?</strong></p>
<p>Enough means the necessary to meet a need or desire. So once you reach that point, everything beyond that is extra. Unnecessary. Wasteful, even.</p>
<p><strong>Is the glass half full or half empty?</strong>  <em>(Is that even the correct question?)</em></p>
<p>There is a strong minimalism trend in a number of circles. You can find excesses in minimalism as well, as many try to do away with everything except the bare spartan essentials of life. In the design world, minimalism appears to mean “Only use black and white please. Hopefully only text.”.  But in some cases, enough means more than black and white.</p>
<p>There is an old adage to “take everything in moderation”. That is a fine way to avoid excesses, but then again, taking “everything in moderation” is in itself excessive. More than “enough” (so go crazy every once in a while). </p>
<p>It’s a good idea to stop every now and again to ask yourself, “What is enough?”  If not, you may never know when you’ve arrived.</p>

                <h3>Ongoing Spanish Translation For Publii CMS</h3>
<p>I have recently had multiple projects based on <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii CMS</a>. Publii is an amazing program that makes it easy to create and manage your website. The developer community has also provided a number of translations. However, one of Publii's previous limitations was the lack of a complete Spanish translation. So, I took it upon myself to fill in the blank.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/publii-trans-2-2xl.webp" alt="Two iMac screens with coding and Publii logo." width="1200" height="675" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Over the course of a month, I reviewed and translated more than 1,300 lines of code into Spanish, both for the main program and for the text editor (theme translations may come at a future date).</p>
<p>Once this was finished I submitted the merge request from my <a href="https://www.github.com/elmikewalsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, which was accepted at the start of the new year.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can click the button below to download the latest Spanish language pack for Publii CMS.</p>

                <p>On Sunday, December 17, Chile will (again) go to the polls to vote on the new constitution proposal. In very very general political terms, while the first proposal a couple years back was seen as “leftist”, the new one has been prepared by a predominantly right-wing group. It is a simple vote: Do you approve of the new constitution?  Yes or No. Simple question. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to fuck it up, if you think about it (which, unfortunately, I have). So, here are 4 ways to fuck up a simple yes/no question:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Answer Unprepared:</strong> To vote on a new constitution, you need to read it. You can argue all you want about how it’s long, not everyone has the education level to understand it, etc. If you are reading this, you can read the constitution. Is it long?  Hell, yeah. Over 170 pages.  Is it really interesting?  Not so much.  But considering it is an overreaching document that serves as a sort of national guide for maybe at least 100 years, it might be important.  And considering how much time we spend on phones, on Netflix, on stuff that really isn’t essential to the day-to-day, it’s more irresponsibility or laziness that we don’t bother.  Even if you don’t read it all, at least read some parts. Maybe the ones you feel are the most important.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Someone Else’s Answer:</strong> Love this one. People all the time complain about how everyone is only interested in themselves and their own well-being; government is only interested in keeping power. But when it comes time to vote yes/no on a constitution, we open it, see how many pages it is, and resort to…. The opinions of other and/or the news. It hurts to think for myself, please think for me. My favorite is when people bitch and moan about how politicians are corrupt, then check to see what their favorite political party is going to vote. Lovely.</li>
<li><strong>Vote Based On Who Is President:</strong> This one is absurd. A constitution (democratically prepared) is larger than one (or several) administrations. Some people will vote in favor (or against) on Sunday based solely on who is currently president. The current president, by the way, has nothing to do with the new document. It’s a bit like saying, “The football team I hate uses blue uniforms, so I hate football.”</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Answer The Question:</strong> Annulling your vote for president or senator or what have you is one thing (still think those annulled votes should have some consequence). But this is a document that will be around for a while (if approved) so good to have an opinion. And also, not voting will expose you to a fine.</li>
