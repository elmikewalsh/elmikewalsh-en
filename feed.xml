            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/25/art-of-war-series.webp" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>In today's world, our virtual existence is like a fortress. Just like castles required fortifications for protection, so does your online presence. It may sound daunting, but don't worry, we've poked around the sage advice from the legendary Sun Tzu, master strategist, to help you strengthen your digital defenses without feeling like you're preparing for war.</p>
<h3>Know Your Board Game</h3>
<p>First and foremost, let's look at the importance of knowing the playing field. As Sun Tzu famously said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the digital realm as understanding your various platforms, being aware of where your sensitive information is stored, and identifying any potential vulnerabilities in your online setup. Where have you set up accounts, what information have you provided, how strong is your password, who has access, etc.</p>
<p>Defense is not the only factor at play here - being a sly li’l devil is equally important (in a positive sense, of course…usually…). Sun Tzu valued deceit, and the same principle applies in this situation. Be on your guard against deceptive emails attempting to extract your confidential information or entice you to click on dubious links. Adaptability is also crucial. The digital sphere is constantly evolving, so your defenses must evolve as well. Stay ahead by updating security settings, choosing strong passwords (please refrain from 'password123'), installing and using a password manager (<a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a> and <a href="https://proton.me/pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton Pass</a> are good), and implementing two-factor authentication for added security.</p>
<h3>Ninja Up!</h3>
<p>Don't forget, safeguarding your data is only one piece of the puzzle; safeguarding your identity is just as crucial. Your digital persona warrants just as much caution and protection as your physical self. By delving into Sun Tzu's strategies, you're equipping yourself with the skills of a ninja - swift, elusive to threats, and fortified against any breaches (and ninjas are super cool, of course).</p>
<p>Armed with timeless wisdom and modern savvy, you'll be able to maneuver through the online realm like a seasoned pro, fortifying your virtual fortress against cyber intruders. It's like becoming your own personal cybersecurity hero without needing a superhero cape, and you can return to wearing your underwear under your pants (cough, cough, Superman, cough).</p>

        <content type="html">
            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/24/privacy.webp" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Privacy is a hot topic in 2023. A concern for some, a buzzword for others. Should I care? What can I do? Is it too late? Why bother?</p>
<p>I’d love to say this is your one-stop shop for all the answers, but who am I but one set of hands typing? (Disclaimer: In 2023, this website uses ancient technology – I am a human writing this article from scratch; no Artificial Intelligence added).</p>
<p><strong>But some musings on privacy, for what they may be worth:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Privacy is one of those things that you don’t realize you have (or are losing) until you start to lose it (or no longer have it). Then you value it. And it is by that time too difficult to get it back.</li>
<li>A completely different topic (Artificial Intelligence) is in large part our willingness to have signed up for and used online storage, free online photos (Google Photos, for example) and any other service offering too-good-to-be-free storage and functionality. Or is it just a coincidence that many of these “free” services used people as the product and then turned to paid plans right before the start of the big AI boom? Who cares about privacy or what can happen – just sign me up for my free photo storage!</li>
<li>Many consider privacy “too difficult” a topic, requiring work and effort to attend to, and will definitely be interested “later”. I imagine living in a glass house, walking around naked all day, unconcerned that anyone passing by can shoot photos and videos of you now, because later down the road you will invest in curtains and that will just solve the entire problem then and there.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what can be done about privacy (online, at least)? Well, this does not at all aim to be a comprehensive primer on protecting yourself online. Just a small list of ideas and possible solutions / services. I’m not affiliated with any of them, and I get nothing by you clicking any links here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email:</strong> Well, it seems like everyone has their Gmail. Sign up, free space. Free photos. Free collaboration. Free, free, free. Until it isn’t. Sign in to any website easy with your Gmail. They can’t read your email. That’s what they say. And you can simply use Google to search for evidence of that. Remember, they are a business, and they have a bottom line. You might consider more private email options such as <a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProtonMail</a>, <a href="https://skiff.com/mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skiff Mail</a> or <a href="https://postale.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postale.io</a>. Email (or any service) is only as private as the laws of the country in which the service resides, and it is best to consider the allies / strategic partners of foreign countries (consider searching for things like “Five Eyes” and other related terms. Not on Google. Or in their browser. Go for something private.</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> If you type it into a Google search engine, the world knows it. And don’t fool yourself into thinking that “Private / Incognito” means no one knows. Consider using a search engine that does not track you and your every keystroke, such as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://www.startpage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startpage</a> (which uses Google results but strips the tracking info).</li>
<li><strong>Photos:</strong> Google makes money selling advertising. Your information. So the more info they collect on you, the more money they can make. Use any other service. Am I saying that OneDrive or iCloud are private? Hell, no. Does Apple (currently) have a business model of selling advertising to anyone in the universe? No.  So, while it might not be an ideal solution, consider that convenience has a price.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most websites will also use Google Analytics to track you, because companies / sites are obsessed with seeing how much traffic they receive.  This website, by the way, has no tracking or analytics installed. I don’t care. There is a method of contact indicated on this website; if you are interested in it, you will find it easily enough.</p>
<p>Well, those are the musings of the moment. Hope it is of some help to someone!</p>

                <h3>The honest and consistent politician isn’t a unicorn — I think I just saw one over there…</h3>
<p><strong>My special guest</strong></p>
<p>An undeterminable number of days ago, I had a conversation with my wife. Out of nowhere, she asked me:</p>
<ul>
<li>“If you could invite any one person to dine with you, who would you invite?”</li>
<li>I thought about the query for a short time and responded:</li>
<li>“The ex-president of Uruguay, José “Pepe” Mujica.”</li>
<li>“Oh? And why him?”</li>
<li>“Well, in this world where all politicians appear to serve only themselves instead of the people, I feel that he could be one of the only honest and upright politicians remaining.”</li>
<li>“Ok, I’ll set the table for two and a unicorn. By the way, Mike, what do unicorns eat anyways?” she probably thought.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Last Hero</h3>
<p>The filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir_Kusturica">Emir Kusturica</a> is working on a documentary about the life of the expresident of Uruguay called “The Last Hero” (El último héroe). But, why is the old ex-president of a country that is really, really tiny so….famous?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for many people, Mujica is most famous for his controversial legalization of marijuana. But what really got my attention, more than the initiative, and even more than the reasons for enacting it, was the way in which he presented it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an experiment. And just like any experiment, there are naturally risks involved and we have to have the intelligence to know that if this gets too big and becomes out-of-control, we can take a step back. We don’t have to become fanatical.” (Source: La Nación, translation mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When was the last time a politician, in any country, spoke so candidly and said quite openly that something was unsure, and it was important to try it out and not be afraid to make mistakes?</p>
<p>Can you say “<em><strong>never</strong></em>”?</p>
<hr>
<h3>The “Alternative Facts” New World</h3>
<p>One of the first linguistic “gifts” that the Trump administration gave us was the now-famous “alternative facts” costume with which we can now dress up our lies and parade them around as if it were Halloween.</p>
<p>In case you have been living under a rock somewhere, (as if Uruguay wasn’t “living under a rock somewhere”) an advisor to the now-President Trump, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyanne_Conway">Kellyanne Conway</a>, was defending the Press Secretary, who was accused of inaccuracies when explaining the attendance of the president’s inauguration, and made it clear that the Press Secretary was not lying, but rather, offering alternative facts.</p>
<p>Really, now….what is the alternative to a fact?</p>
<p>And what does Mujica have to say about facts and lies?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to know the truth, but I don’t believe a damn in justice.” (Source: <a href="http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2015/05/04/715320/mujica-en-filba.html">Emol.com</a>, translation mine)</p>

<h3>Bigger is better, but…we’re talking about egos here</h3>
<p>The simple life philosophy that the “world’s poorest president” embraces draws a stark contrast with the new, inflated, larger-than-life ego at the helm of the United States. Let’s take a look at the declarations of each one and then you, dear reader, can try to guess who said which:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I might be mistaken, because I often am, but I call it as I see it. (Source: <a href="https://www.publimetro.cl/cl/mundo/2014/03/14/42-frases-jose-pepe-mujica-presidente-mas-querido.html">Publimetro</a>, translation mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Show me someone without an ego, and I’ll show you a loser…” (Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/409593552314712064">Twitter</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gosh, it certainly is a real head-scratcher, isn’t it?</p>
</div>
</section>
<hr class="pm fq kx pn po lh pp pq pr ps pt">

<div class="r mp p q l m">
<h3>Two old guys cut from different cloth</h3>
<p>While one old feller takes control of a nation with a crazy, frenetic energy, desperate to put his personal name and style in the history books, spearheading a new controversy every day, the other has finished his term. Despite his declarations of not wanting to run for reelection, he continues to serve his country as a Senator. He is content with what he has and not what he is lacks; he tends to his garden and trucks around his tiny nation in an old (1987) Volkswagen Beetle.</p>
<p>So, in this acrid environment, full of controversy, scandal and uncertainty, it is necessary, I think, to pause, take a step back and see things — life included — from a different angle.</p>
<p>The world is not a place always filled with flowers and optimism, but neither is it perpetually the inverse. And politicians, like all of us, are only human. We don’t — shouldn’t — depend on them to “save the world” because it is tasked to each of us to “save our world”, wherever it is and however small it may be.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no better way to part ways than with this gem of a quote from the Last of the Mujicans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Despite it all, I believe that the human being that is able not only to improve the world, but also to improve himself. Perhaps I’m mistaken, but let me die with utopias” (Source: <a href="http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2015/05/04/715320/mujica-en-filba.html">Emol</a>, translation mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now go out and make the world a better place, although only one drop, because life won’t do it alone.</p>

                <h3 class="bs fq gu ng bx">How Chileans and non-Chileans understand the Richter Scale.</h3>
<p id="1f69" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">Chilean’s are a particular bunch of people. They live in a country often mistaken for the word “Chili” (and, what’s worse, the geography just happens to resemble a chili….), are surrounded by ocean to the west, mountains to the east, and their country is only as wide as, say, the state of Illinois in the U.S., but over 4,000km long!</p>
<p id="dbf4" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">Yup, it’s that “skinny country” down there in South America.</p>
<p id="35ff" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">And, one other small detail — the Earth under their feet moves. A lot.</p>

<p id="6a6f" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is natural, therefore, that Chileans have become accustomed to seismic events. However, the visitor to Chile may not be as experienced. Never fear, help is on the way!</p>
<p id="ff98" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">A Chilean children’s book author, Mauricio Paredes, created the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/habiaotravez/posts/10153313619048972" class="bc co ic id ie if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seismic Manuel for Foreigners</a> (in Spanish).

<p id="7192" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">A nerdy tip to manage those untidy Excel documents.</p>
<p id="f5c5" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">There is no better way to spend an afternoon than by working hard, copying and pasting first and last names into different columns so that you can import your Excel list into a program like <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/" class="bc co ic id ie if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a> or <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/" class="bc co ic id ie if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surveymonkey</a> (or whatever) in order to send your emails, newsletters, surveys and the like.</p>
<p id="81de" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you really like copying and pasting your life away, I recommend you stop reading this and get back to work. But, if you prefer to free up hours of your life and look smart in the process…..read on!</p>

<h3 id="a355" class="oh go dg bt bs di oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os">The Context</h3>
<p id="c9b9" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr ot ht ou nm ov no ow nq ox ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">I will detail a case that frequently occurs in my work. Your experience should be modified to fit your reality. I am often tasked with sending out a newsletter or survey. The list of recipients arrives in the form of an Excel document. If I am fortunate, the document is relatively tidy and there are no spelling errors (one can dream). But, in almost all cases, the information comes in two columns — one with the email addresses, and one with the first and last name(s).</p>
<p id="1d07" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">The problem? Programs and sites like <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/" class="bc co ic id ie if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/" class="bc co ic id ie if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surveymonkey</a> allow you great personalization of your emails, allowing you to target and use things like the recipient’s first name, last name, or other data, but <strong class="hq oy"><em class="oz">only if it is in its own column</em></strong>.</p>
<p id="8cc3" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">So, how can we clean up our first/last name problem without cutting and pasting all day? With a couple of formulas.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/2.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/2-xs.webp 300w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/2-sm.webp 480w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/2-md.webp 768w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<h3 id="42f1" class="oh go dg bt bs di oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os">The Process</h3>
<p id="38c6" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr ot ht ou nm ov no ow nq ox ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">I will use a few illustrations to demonstrate. First, we want to make sure that the first and last names are all in one nice and near column. Make sure that there are empty columns to the right of your <strong class="hq oy">First/Last Name</strong> column; it isn’t necessary, but it will make your life easier.</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="4690" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now, go to the very top of your <strong class="hq oy">First/Last Name</strong> column, and highlight the column immediately to the right.</li>
<li id="309f" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr pd ht pe nm pf no pg nq ph ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">In that first empty cell, insert the following formula:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="oa ob oc od oe lf jn ea"><span id="e291" class="oh go dg bt pi b fr pj pk s pl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="pi oy">=LEFT(A1,FIND(" ",A1,1)-1)</strong></span></pre>
<p id="307d" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hq oy">(Note: formatting error with quotes above now fixed — copy and use!)</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li id="a742" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then click <strong class="hq oy">Enter</strong>. If all went well, you should see the first name reproduced in the empty cell where you put the formula. One important note — look at the formula, where it shows B1. This assumes that the first entry for your First/Last name column is in cell B1. If it is not, you <strong class="hq oy"><em class="oz">must</em></strong> change it to the correct value. (B1, or whatever. See the image).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="oa ob oc od oe lf jn ea"><span id="cbda" class="oh go dg bt pi b fr pj pk s pl" data-selectable-paragraph="">=LEFT(B1,FIND(" ",B1,1)-1)</span></pre>
<p id="72b9" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hq oy"><em class="oz">(Note: formatting error with quotes above now fixed — copy and use!)</em></strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li id="7dbb" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then click <strong class="hq oy">Enter</strong>. If all went well, you should see the first name reproduced in the empty cell where you put the formula. One important note — look at the formula, where it shows B1.

<ul class="">
<li id="89a2" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you enter the formula correctly and press Enter, (<strong class="hq oy"><em class="oz">don’t</em></strong> click on a different cell while entering the formula!) you should see the first name alone in a cell. Congrats!</li>
<li id="6a6e" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr pd ht pe nm pf no pg nq ph ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now, left-click on the first cell and drag the mouse down to the end of your list. You should have the whole column highlighted. Then click CTRL + D, and the column will magically fill with all the first names from your previous First/Last Name column.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="">
<li id="201a" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Moving on, click on the first cell at the top of the next column (to the right of where your First Names only are. Then, enter the following formula:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="oa ob oc od oe lf jn ea"><span id="f867" class="oh go dg bt pi b fr pj pk s pl" data-selectable-paragraph="">=RIGHT(B1,LEN(B1)-FIND(" ",B1,1))</span></pre>

<ul class="">
<li id="a509" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Change the value B1 if necessary. Repeat the same process as above, and you should see the last name only in the first cell.</li>
<li id="c30f" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr pd ht pe nm pf no pg nq ph ib pa pb pc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Duplicate the process noted above, left-clicking on the first cell and dragging down and pressing CTRL + D to fill the column with <strong class="hq oy">Last Names</strong> only.</li>
</ul>

<div class="gs gt bx bt bs fq na nb nc nd ne nf gw">Now, you could stop there, and save your document (I save it as both an Excel document and a .CSV document — the latter of which is a favorite for importing contacts). There is just one small issue. Your new First and Last Name columns are tied to formulas. If you click on a cell with the First/Last name only, you will see the formula we used instead of the plain text as the cell value.</div>
<div class="gs gt bx bt bs fq na nb nc nd ne nf gw"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/6.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/6-xs.webp 300w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/6-sm.webp 480w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/6-md.webp 768w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/6-lg.webp 1024w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/6-xl.webp 1360w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/13/responsive/6-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></div>
<div class="gs gt bx bt bs fq na nb nc nd ne nf gw">
<p id="6df7" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">To fix this, we simply highlight the First/Last Name columns, and press CTRL + C ( or right-click and select Copy…). Then, we paste the copied columns into two different, empty columns, (it doesn’t matter which columns you paste into). However, we don’t want to paste using CTRL + V. Instead, right-click and you will see multiple paste options. Select the icon that has a 123 at the bottom. This is called <strong class="hq oy">Paste as Values</strong>. If you do this, you are separating the First/Last Names from the formulas, and can freely cut and paste them wherever you want in the future.</p>
<p id="88cb" class="ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib" data-selectable-paragraph="">Well, that’s all here. Hope this makes your life easier. Hey, why not make my life easier and click that green heart icon at the bottom of this article, so that more people can enjoy it?</p>
