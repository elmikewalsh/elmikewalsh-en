                <h3>If It's Swiss, It's Secure - Swiss Cheese has holes In It, and so does this idea.</h3>
<p>I’ve recently had the pleasure (torture) of studying in-depth many, many, many free and paid email solutions, looking for the perfect solution for family, personal and work. As a bit of context, after waking up the need to leave Google for privacy concerns (my phone does not have a single Google application - yay!).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went first to <a href="https://proton.me/" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton</a> and stayed there for about a year, as a Visionary client (when I go in, it’s all in).</p>
<p class="p1">In the end, I can’t say that Proton was bad, just way more than I needed, and way more expensive than I wanted. Though I will note that exporting out of Proton, and the subsequent attempt to downgrade my account to Unlimited from Visionary, rather than canceling, was quite evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">(when making high-tier customers press CANCEL, btw, don’t secretly downgrade me to a lesser plan and charge me. I will expose you here for the dozens of bots and half-dozen people who visit to see)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Anyways, in my search for the “perfect” email company for me, I came across a number of companies that pushed the idea that “our servers are in XYZ country (usually Switzerland) and so your data is completely safe. Laws here protect your privacy. (In one famous and extreme case, your data is stored in underground bunkers impervious to nuclear attacks. Good to know in the case all life on the planet is screwed, my email is safe).</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s the thing about the above argument (not the bunker) - your data is only safe if the laws protecting them in that country never change. Ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case the government changes, or new laws are passed, or your country is invaded, your laws and Swiss protection don’t mean anything at all.</p>
<p class="p1">So, not really sure why you would push that as a sales point.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe you are relying on the tradition argument - <em>“Our country has never….”</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or <em>“We would never….”</em></p>
<p class="p1">I’m not saying that the services that promote this are bad email companies. Far from it; most of them are pretty good.</p>
<p class="p1">For those who are attracted by the privacy laws argument, just turn on the toxic world news and count how many countries and governments are now doing things that haven’t been done before. Things that they would “never do”.</p>
<p class="p1">And I’m thinking about the democratically run countries.</p>
<p class="p1">My point (if any)?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Your information is not secure or private just because it is in a specific country or region. Privacy and security has much more to do with encryption than location.</strong></p>

                <p class="p1">I’m sure many people have said that before. I’m not one to rail against companies for being large, faceless, cold, and motivated only by money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I used Microsoft products and worked on Windows for over 30 years. I can’t really say I have a personal feeling about them one way or the other.</p>
<p class="p1">However, they recently decided to increase their Microsoft 365 prices, for Basic and Family plans. Ok, that in itself is nothing new, as companies do that from time to time, maybe even for reasonable excuses.</p>
<p class="p1">But the way in which it is being implemented is terrible and shows no consideration for the consumer.</p>
<p class="p1">This <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/microsoft-365-gets-massive-45-percent-price-hike-and-its-all-to-do-with-ai-tools" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">article from Tom’s Guide</a> provides the scoop. I take exception to (many things people say/write), but particularly the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Microsoft will increase the prices of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family in the U.S. by $3 per month or $30 for annual subscriptions. It's the first price hike since 365 launched, <strong>but the good news is users don't have to opt-in for the AI upgrade.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Read that again: “<strong>But the good news is users don't have to opt-in for the AI upgrade.</strong>” Ok, so the good news is that a half-baked AI implementation that no one wants is being forced upon me, and I do not have to take any action to pay more for it.</p>
<p class="p1">If I would rather NOT have this “feature”, then I have to jump through hoops to NOT have it. What great news! Work to not get charged for crap.</p>
<p class="p1">I used to not care one way or the other, but now….</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fuck you, Microsoft.</strong></p>

</div>
<p>I imagine most people just fire up their trusty Gmail account, check and send mail, and call it a day.  But when you think about changing to a service that doesn't openly read and spy on your email, it begins to turn into a lot of work.</p>
<p>My head is to the point it might actually explode. I could go into a lot of detail about each service I encountered, tried and discarded. I'm happy to say that the crusade is coming to an end. On that note, I wanted to share a bit of my findings, in the hopes that it might help other people who are looking for a good, reliable service.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Context:</strong> I am not looking for a high threat-model, military-grade encrypted email. I am looking for a service that will offer general encryption from a company that won't spy on me, or charge me a fortune. Here's what I have found, and my opinions:</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ih991dk93u">Proton</h3>
<p>Had this email set up for family. Actually, I can only say good things about the service offered. The problem? Once it was decided that the offering was more than we were willing to pay, the migration began - as well as the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an organization, I could export all member email except for my own. It turns out it threw up an unknown error, and support finally said it was a really rare issue that was unlikely to be fixed. So instead of receiving an easy-to-use MBOX output, I had to export EML files and import them into the next service. </li>
<li>Once we canceled our plan (Visionary, no less) they confirmed cancellation, but secretly downgraded us to an Unlimited plan. Was not expecting to be charged again, and had to go in and cancel a second time. That is terrible service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ih991dk93v">Fastmail</h3>
<p>Fastmail offered a Family plan, which was a reasonable price. Setup was nice and quick. I can't really think of much to say. I did not like the mobile app because of things like Notes, Calendar, Files, being there, and there is no function to remove them. Fastmail was "meh" - can't really say I enjoy them, or not. Might be for you. Not for me.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ih991dk940">Purelymail</h3>
<p>Great setup, easy, really reasonable pricing ($10/year) for unlimited space, domains, email accounts. Backend is ugly as sin, and if you are not proficient in setting up DNS records, this is not for you.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ih991dk941">MXRoute</h3>
<p>Checking this one out, this may be what I am looking for. I'll update this once I learn more.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ih991dk942">iCloud Mail</h3>
<p>I really want to like this one. I really do. I will go into detail why I can't later. For me, it has to do with multiple domain emails and really wanting a separate inbox for each one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ok that's my rant for now. Thanks, hope it's of help, and will update as time permits.</p>

</div>
<p class="p3"><strong>Remembering the good old days when 4G was the latest “high-speed internet” and websites were designed to load quickly.</strong></p>
<p class="p3">There I was, in the heart of South Central Chile, end of August, living a simple, common life of internet addiction - until the storms hit. First, the power flickered out. Then, the internet followed suit, leaving me in a dark, disconnected void.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Welcome to No-Internet Hell, where you’re left remembering the good ol’ days of 4G when it felt like the future was at your fingertips, hoping that a drop of that will magically trickle down to you. Well, at least when we weren’t stuck on 3G... </p>
<p class="p3">Two weeks without a connection. And when there was a connection, it was - gasp - 3G. (Not 3 gbps fiber optic. I’m talking about the “mobile” 3G). Before the almighty internet returned to bless us with its presence, I had a lot of time to reflect—mostly on how much I missed reading <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/your-internet-speed-and-that-of-your-websites-visitor-probably-sucks/">articles about terrible internet speeds</a>. Who knew those words would become my life?</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iav8n6uha" class="p3">The “Good Old” 4G Days</h3>
<p class="p3">Remember when 4G was the best thing since sliced bread? We all thought it was the beginning of a new era. But here’s the kicker: most of the time, you were stuck on 3G because 4G coverage was spotty at best. Back then, even 3G felt like a miracle compared to the dreaded 0G, where your phone became an expensive paperweight. But when 4G actually worked, oh, how fast it was. Websites loaded before you could blink (we didn’t blink much, back in my day). It was quick enough that you didn’t have time to think about how much they sucked (now we just don’t think; that’s what AI is for!).</p>
<p class="p3">Of course, that was back when websites weren’t bogged down with gigabytes of data-hogging nonsense. Remembering this fine piece of literature, <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/your-internet-speed-and-that-of-your-websites-visitor-probably-sucks/">Your Internet Speed and That of Your Website’s Visitor Probably Sucks</a>, we’ve made things worse by designing websites that only load quickly if you’ve got NASA-level bandwidth. These days, if you’re stuck on 4G - or heaven forbid, 3G - you might as well go make a sandwich while the page loads. And watch the paint on the walls dry. Wherever it needs drying.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iav8n6uib" class="p3">Talking With Myself - Or Not (Who Are These People?)</h3>
<p class="p3">After a few days without the internet, I did what any sane person would do: restarted the router. When that didn’t work (shocking, I know), I moved on to the next best thing—restarting it again. Maybe it would come back! (It didn’t.) So, left with no other option, I actually talked to the people around me. I know, terrifying. It’s not that I dislike conversation, but after so long with the internet, I completely forgot why those other people shared the same space that I did. :)</p>
<p class="p3">I also discovered something fascinating: card games and board games still exist. Yes, those relics from a pre-digital age. They’re not as fun as YouTube or Instagram, but at least no one has to worry about buffering. After a few rounds of <em>carioca</em>, I was ready to crawl back to the 4G days, even if it meant living with the constant cycle of switching to 3G mid-download.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iav91b9bs" class="p3">14 Days at the End of the World</h3>
<p class="p3">Productivity without the internet? It’s a joke. Sure, at first you think, “I’ll finally get some offline work done.” Spoiler: no, you won’t. You’ll realize how deeply you depend on Google for even the most basic tasks, like remembering how long it takes to cook rice. Remember the pre-historic days when we went to the bathroom with a book, and not a phone? (a phone doesn't serve the same dual-purpose that a good ol' paper book can in an emergency)</p>
<p class="p3">Even trying to remember what life was like before we were all glued to the life line that is WiFi feels like a stretch. And yet, ironically, my article on <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/your-internet-speed-and-that-of-your-websites-visitor-probably-sucks/">why internet speeds suck</a> kept bouncing around my head. Turns out I had firsthand experience now of how bad a slow (or non-existent) connection really is.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iav8n6uic" class="p3">A Dear Friend Returns</h3>
<p class="p3">After an eternity (or so it seemed), the internet came back. My router lit up like a Christmas tree, and I was back online. But the victory was bittersweet. There’s no immediate rush to watch all the Netflix I missed or <a href="https://medium.com/@elmikewalsh/list/in-english-baf770234cb3" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">binge-read Medium articles</a>. Instead, I started reflecting on how we got here—how we built a digital world so bloated with content that even 4G can feel sluggish now (or, at least, that’s what I would like you to think. In reality, it was a frantic rush to make 2 weeks of backlogged projects go away).</p>
<p class="p3">It’s funny, isn’t it? We used to get by with simpler, faster websites. Now we need insane speeds just to keep up with the junk we’ve crammed into them. So if you’re out there still dealing with terrible load times and sluggish sites, I feel for ya. But don’t worry - you’re not missing anything other than crap being pushed and loaded faster and faster.</p>

<p class="p1">Ah, Medium. The land of dreams, where writers come to share their deepest thoughts and worst takes on minimalism. Some are here for community, others for the joy of writing, but most of us came for one thing: cash. Via that glorious <a href="https://medium.com/partner-program" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium Partner Program</a> (MPP) money, which we were told would be flowing our way just for sharing our brilliant ideas. The digital gold rush.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m here to tell you how I turned that dream into reality. I’ve done it. I made $0.04 in one month on Medium. You’re probably asking yourself, “How can I achieve this level of success?” Don’t worry. I’ve got you covered.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iaq3dh5t5m" class="p1">Ignorance Writes Itself</h3>
<p class="p1">Everyone knows that expertise is overrated. On Medium, it’s all about pretending to know stuff. The key is confidence. The trick is to sprinkle in buzzwords like “mindfulness,” “side hustle,” and “growth mindset.” If you really want to maximize earnings, toss in some crypto talk, even if your only knowledge of cryptocurrency is that it's not a physical coin.</p>
<p class="p1">After initially resisting, on the principle that hard work and effort pay off, I switched to this method, convinced that my in-depth “advice” on how to maximize your website development by following my convoluted <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/wordpress-2024-static-website-generator/">15-step process to output your WordPress website as a static site</a>. Spoiler: it didn’t.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iaq3dh5t5n" class="p1">Find Your Truly Unique Nobody-Is-Doing-This Niche</h3>
<p class="p1">I thought I’d stand out by finding the perfect niche. After all, Medium’s full of articles on digital nomads, minimalism and making one digital product and selling 325 variations for $50k a month, so I decided to niche down to something <i>truly unique</i>. I wrote about <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/the-art-of-a-good-password/">how to create a good password</a>. A masterpiece. Naturally, I expected the algorithm to throw my post to the top of the platform.</p>
<p class="p1">What I discovered is that Medium loves niches... if your niche happens to be crypto, minimalism, or tech startups. A heartfelt in-depth guide on how to make a good password? Not so much.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iaq3dh5t5o" class="p1">Neurotic Stat Tracking</h3>
<p class="p1">This is the real joy of Medium. It’s like checking your social media for likes—on steroids. The moment you hit “publish,” you’ll find yourself obsessively refreshing the stats page. At first, you’ll be optimistic. You’ll picture the hundreds of views piling up, the comments flooding in, the claps accumulating. But instead, you’ll see numbers that look more like the cost of a pack of gum.</p>
<p class="p1">After a week of watching my stats like a hawk, my first milestone arrived. A whopping <strong>two</strong> cents. At that point, I began calculating how long it would take me to buy an actual cup of coffee with my Medium earnings. (It’s a very long time.)</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iaq3dh5t5p" class="p1">Show Me The Money!</h3>
<p class="p1">Then it happened. After weeks of pouring my heart and soul into my content, the moment of truth arrived. I checked my stats one last time for the month and saw it: <strong>$0.04</strong>. I made it. The big leagues.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/earnings-image.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my $0.04 earnings." width="728" height="562" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/responsive/earnings-image-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/responsive/earnings-image-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/responsive/earnings-image-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/responsive/earnings-image-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/responsive/earnings-image-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/67/responsive/earnings-image-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p class="p1">It was time to celebrate. I poured myself a glass of tap water, sat back, and basked in the glow of my monumental success. Could I afford a yacht? No. Could I afford an iPhone? Nope. But I was officially a paid writer. Technically.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1iaq3dh5t5q" class="p1">The Lessons Learned</h3>
<p class="p1">Making money on Medium is, well, possible. Technically. But it’s not about the money (good thing, right?). It’s about the thrill of putting your thoughts into the world and seeing them resonate with, let’s be honest, probably just your mom. That $0.04 is a symbol of potential. The potential to someday—perhaps many, may, may, many years from now—afford a pack of gum.</p>
<p class="p1">So, if you're ready to become a Medium millionaire, remember this: it's not about the payout. It’s about the journey of seeing that stat page inch forward. Someday, with enough perseverance, you might just be able to buy that yacht. Or at least a cup of coffee. Full steam ahead!</p>

                <p class="post__last-updated"><strong>Update:</strong> We have a winner. Made the jump to an iPhone 16 Pro natural color.  :)</p>
<h3 class="p1">Quick Note: I Didn’t Manage It</h3>
<p class="p1">Hello and welcome to October (which started 2 weeks ago).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For those of you who are not in those special privileged countries that get access to the latest Apple products about a week after launch…. October means “we can buy them too!” month.</p>
<p class="p1">So Apple so lovingly tried to make it really easy to choose this year - 4 models (iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max). In an attempt to level the playing field, the iPhone 16 / iPhone 16 Plus are more or less the same, only a different size.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the iPhone 16 Pro / iPhone 16 Pro are the same, except for a different size (and battery size as well).</p>
<p class="p1">To make things even “easier”, the non-pro phones this year are REALLY close to the Pro phones in features. There are about 1,000,000 reviews of these phones on the internet, so I won’t add one here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I will say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Coming from an iPhone 13 Pro Max, wanting a physically smaller phone but loving a physically larger screen, the decision is really. difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Still haven’t decided, and this article is more of a rant about how difficult it is to choose tech when you know all the tiny tech details. At this time of year I kinda envy those who base their decision on simpler details, such as, “I want a pink one”, or “I just want the same version I have now, only the new version”.</p>
<p class="p1">Moral of the story: Sometimes having all the information just means that decision-making is a PITA. Sometimes, I guess, ignorance *is* bliss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>:)</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckag3mo"><strong>WordPress: Make Your Website a Static Website With WordPress In 2024 For Free</strong></h3>
<p>Hello, we’re back at it in 2024! The plan here is install WordPress in an offline environment, develop our website, with all the designs, posts, pages and plugins that you like, and then “export it” as a static website using a WordPress plugin. Since my original article in 2016, a lot has changed; WordPress has grown, and there is a new plugin to streamline this process. </p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/wordpress-my-favorite-static-site-generator/">the process I wrote about waaaaay back in 2016</a>, which apparently got a fair amount of attention. Here’s we’ll look at some updated steps to make the process more modern and streamlined, as well as discover a great place to get some free WordPress themes.</p>
<p>You will want to have the following to complete this process</p>
<ol>
<li>A website idea</li>
<li>Website content (text, images, etc., ready to add into your WordPress website)</li>
<li>An internet connection</li>
<li>A computer (Mac, Linux, Windows)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckag3mp">Why Would Anyone Do This?</h3>
<p>Each person has their specific way of doing things. A particular process. A unique workflow. There are probably people who would ask me, “Why would you use WordPress to generate static websites? Couldn’t you just use an already existing static site generator?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, in 2024, I would personally recommend using <a href="https://www.getpublii.com" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii CMS</a>. It is amazing! (they don't pay me to say that. They don't even know).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I know many, many, many people use WordPress and have too much time and work invested in that platform. That in itself is a reason to do this. So if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Really comfortable with WordPress, but don’t have the time to learn another system, just to create a static website.</li>
<li>You have a client who has a WordPress theme, or insists on using WordPress and simply wants the fastest website possible.</li>
<li>Just prefer to use WordPress for whatever reason, but are interested in making your website faster and safer...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This may be of interest to you.</strong></p>
<p>There are also some more convincing reasons. Such as this: <strong>Security</strong>. <a href="https://bloggerspassion.com/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress, as of May 2024, powers over 43% of all websites in the world</a>. That makes WordPress a huge target for hackers, scammers, and the lot. And even if you keep your WordPress installation up-to-date, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/almost-a-million-wordpress-websites-at-risk-from-this-security-flaw-heres-what-you-need-to-know-to-keep-your-site-safe" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">a forgotten or deactivated plugin on your website could create an accidental “back door”</a> for hackers to take over and cause havoc.</p>
<p>What if you could create a website using WordPress on your computer, and then publish it as a static website? And by doing so you eliminate many of the security issues inherent in with databases, non-updated themes, software and plugins? And, as a bonus, your site is FAST?</p>
<p><strong>Yes. You can.</strong> </p>
<p>If you want to know how, read on.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckag3mq">What We’ll Do / What You'll Need</h3>
<p>Here you’ll get a good step-by-step on how to set up a local server and install WordPress (the process is muuuuuch easier today). From there, you will add your content, design, layout, etc. (this is not a design article – that part is all you).</p>
<p>Once you finish setting up your website in WordPress and are at the point where you would “publish” it for the world to see….. that’s where we will change gears. We will upload this static website to the internet (using FTP or whatever you like).</p>
<p>As a bonus, in a follow-up article I will share with you a play-by-play on how to export your website to GitHub. (you can set up a simple website on GitHub for free, provided it isn’t super high traffic or requiring advanced scripting). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before you invest your valuable time reading, take note of the following:</strong></span></p>
<p>This article might not be for you if the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t use WordPress…</li>
<li>If you don’t know how to install WordPress…</li>
<li>If you desire to have your visitors leave comments (using the WordPress comment feature)…</li>
<li>If you require real-time, dynamic areas on your website…</li>
<li>If you aren’t creating a website…</li>
<li>If you don’t have internet…</li>
<li>If you are looking for an advanced eCommerce website</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the case, I'll understand if you drift off to some other place. (but this article might be of use to someone you know - so please share it).</p>
<p>Ready to begin? Let's go!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckelai1g">Step 1: Download LocalWP</h3>
<p>Ok so in order to install WordPress on our computer without moving it to a server, we need to setup a “server” on our computer. Previously we used a program called XAMPP, which is a bit technical and overkill for what we want to do. </p>
<p>For this process, we are going to download <a href="https://localwp.com" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">LocalWP</a>. There are other options available to set up WordPress offline (such as XAMPP and Studio by WordPress). However, XAMPP is more technical and overkill for what we want to do. And Studio is not currently compatible with the Staatic WP Plugin which we will use to create our static Wordpress site. So head on over to LocalWP and click the download button.</p>
<p>You will need to choose your platform and enter some information. You can enter whatever info you like, including for the email address. Once submitted, you will be able to download the program.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/1-2.jpg" alt="LocalWP download screen requesting basic info" width="604" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2uqaroqm">Step 2: Set Up LocalWP</h3>
<p>Once you have finished installing the program, you will see options to <strong>Create a New Site</strong> (default option), <strong>Create From a Blueprint</strong> or <strong>Select an Existing ZIP</strong>. Choose the CREATE A NEW SITE option and then CONTINUE.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/2-2.jpg" alt="LocalWP set up screen to create a new website." width="2372" height="1584" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p>You will then see screens asking you to NAME YOUR WEBSITE, choose your SITE ENVIRONMENT and SET UP WORDPRESS. On the final screen you will set your WordPress username, password and email (if you want). In the ADVANCED OPTIONS below, you can click that and indicate if this is a MultiSite installation. Once you are ready, click the ADD SITE button.</p>
<div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery"  data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3">
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/3.jpg" data-size="1192x798"><img src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/3-thumbnail.webp" alt="LocalWP screen asking to name website" width="720" height="482"></a></figure>
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/4.jpg" data-size="1198x798"><img src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/4-thumbnail.webp" alt="LocalWP screen asking to choose server environment" width="720" height="480"></a></figure>
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/5.jpg" data-size="1194x794"><img src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/5-thumbnail.webp" alt="LocalWP screen asking to set up WordPress credentials" width="720" height="479"></a></figure>
</div></div>
<p>After the setup is complete, you will see the following screen. Note the WP Admin button - you'll next want to click that button to login to your website. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/6.jpg" alt="Screen in LocalWP that shows once site is set up." width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p>However, first, please make this small but important change. You will want to change your web server to APACHE in the following section, then click the APPLY text that appears:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/pre-6.jpg" alt="Change LocalWP server to Apache." width="1182" height="789" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2uqe85f10">Step 3: Update Permalinks</h3>
<p>You will need to go to the permalinks section of your WP admin and choose an option other than the default. The Staatic WP Plugin will not work if you use the default permalinks.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/8.jpg" alt="WordPress admin screen showing location of Permalinks" width="655" height="435" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckddrj1a">Step 4: Install Staatic - Static Site Generator</h3>
<p>We are going to install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/staatic/" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  rel="noopener noreferrer">Staatic Site Generator WP Plugin</a> here to complete the setup of our process. You could complicate life by doing this manually, but since we just installed WordPress and have an internet connection, just follow the steps below.</p>
<p>First we want to go to the Admin section of our website. So click the WP Admin link, which you should see here:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/7.jpg" alt="Local WP - Screenshot with link to WP Admin" width="1190" height="793" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p>This will open up in a new browser window. From here, go to the PLUGINS sections and select ADD NEW PLUGIN</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/4.jpg" alt="WordPress backend and where to add Plugins" width="1540" height="915" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p>On the new screen type STAATIC (note the spelling) and the following should appear. Click the INSTALL NOW button. Once completed, click the ACTIVATE button that appears.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/5.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing how to install Staatic Static Site WordPress Plugin" width="1629" height="661" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckddrj1a">Step 5: Staatic Static Site Generator Options</h3>
<p>From here the plugin is pretty simple, but there are a couple of options that may be important to you:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/6-2.jpg" alt="Staatic Site plugin Deployment options." width="1113" height="339" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p><strong>Destination URL:</strong> The plugin recommends an absolute URL. This means that, ideally, you know what your full website address will be (for example: <a href="http://www.example.com"  class="extlink extlink-icon-1 "  >www.example.com</a>). In that case, you enter that here and save.  If not, or if you plan on using this on different websites, leave the default option as-is.</p>
<p>For now, set it to OFFLINE URL, so once we Publish this site we can actually open it offline and view it.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/7-2.jpg" alt="Staatic Site plugin Deployment location options." width="1054" height="654" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p><strong>Deployment Method (on the DEPLOYMENT tab):</strong> These are the options on how and where you would like to generate your new static website. By default LOCAL DIRECTORY is selected, meaning the plugin will create your new static website in a folder on your computer, and then you move it where you want to. However, there are other options to deploy (publish) directly to the internet. In a future article we will take a look at how to publish your website to GitHub. For now, if you don’t have a specific deployment destination, just leave it as LOCAL DIRECTORY.</p>
<p><strong>Target Directory:</strong> Directly related to the option above. This is where your static website copy will be created on your computer. You may want to note this - or change it - so you aren't hunting for your new static website on your computer later.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i2ckddrj1a">Step 6: Generate Your Website</h3>
<p>Ok we've made it to the last step - once you are ready with your website, you can click on the STAATIC option in the WP Admin, and click the second link - Publications. On the new screen that appears, click the PUBLISH NOW button.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/9.jpg" alt="Publishing screen in the Staatic WP plugin." width="1086" height="586" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p>If all goes according to plan, you should see a series of information after the process is complete (it will surely look different than the following screen).</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/10.jpg" alt="Staatic WP Plugin successfully deploying your website." width="1767" height="994" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p>If there are no errors, you should be all set! You can click on the RESOURCES tab (see image above) or the DOWNLOAD link in the following image to download your new website.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/11.jpg" alt="Download your new static WordPress website." width="1764" height="710" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-xs.webp 640w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-sm.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-md.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-lg.webp 1366w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-xl.webp 1600w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<hr>
<p>Thank you for making it this far! I hope this guide was useful. In a follow-up article I will show you how to deploy that new static website directly to GitHub, so you can have a simple, fast, safe and free (hosting) website!</p>
