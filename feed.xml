                <h3>Perplexity, copyrights and citing your work - the good ol' days</h3>
<p>AI is in the news. In daily conversations. In your social media feeds (if you do that still).  AI is the digital magic wand that will make all your dreams come true: construct your code, paint your pictures and write your articles.  Or, at least, in some cases it will write your articles. In other cases, it will simply steal them from people who already wrote them (do people still write things on the internet?)</p>
<h3>How Confusing: Perplexity</h3>
<p>In case you haven’t heard, the latest scandal involves the company Perplexity, which, in summary, was caught copying articles that were not theirs and not attributing the source of the articles. I won’t summarize, as the company is not worth the time. You can catch up on it here. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations</a></p>
<p>In summary, it is the digital equivalent of going to a store, shoplifting a product, changing the label, and selling it in your store.  Amazing business model! Why didn’t anyone think of that before.</p>
<h3>Old School Accreditation</h3>
<p>Being a bit older, I am reminded of famous musical acts such as Milli Vanilli (side note: tragic story. search for it on the internet. You might even find an original journalistic note, rather than regurgitated AI tripe). Or just click here - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli</a></p>
<p>Why is Milli Vanilli famous?  Mainly for supposedly singing when they weren’t.</p>
<p>Back in the day, claiming something was yours when it wasn’t was not well received.</p>
<p>Today, however, it is apparently a very successful business model.</p>
<p>I remember back in school if you turned in an assignment without attributing your sources, you received a 0.</p>
<p>Maybe that should remain the model to follow?</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>I spent 30 minutes Googling how to build homes in my sleep using the new GPT Hammer &amp; Nails, and sold them with just a few clicks on Instagram. The internet is full of opportunities. Just a quick search on Google will show you there are hundreds of results for a ton of people with the same three “make money in your sleep” ideas that have already saturated the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> If there are a ton of articles on how to do this, any real market is already saturated and you’re only going to compete for what little falls from the people who already set up those businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnm71plm">The Full Scoop</h3>
<p>Ok, for those of you who are curious and want to keep reading (didn’t stop above), I think many of us have considered it, especially in the post-pandemic economic inflation-ridden world that is 2023-2024:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can I set up a business quickly that makes, sells and ships products quickly and automatically, and I just receive the proceeds automatically in my bank account?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great, right?  Almost too good to be true.  If that message arrived in your email inbox, and you clicked the link provided - I sure hope you have a good antivirus program.</p>
<p>But seriously, since AI, ChatGPT, etc. is all the rage right now, I did a quick search for how to make $XYZ/month automatically using ChatGPT. Because…why not, right?</p>
<p>It seems that everyone has written an article about this amazing miracle, which seems to involve buying stock designs, having ChatGPT spit out silly messages, and automating t-shirt/product creation.  Then they just sell themselves, right?</p>
<p>I do ask myself, “Self, if everyone has economic issues at this point ….who the hell is buying this stuff?!?</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnm71pmn">The Full House</h3>
<p>Now, in theory, the articles describe an interesting process on how to make money. And, unless the authors just made it up (which is also possible), then it makes money for someone.</p>
<p>But, as is the case with anything “in”, once someone sees that XYZ is a success, then EVERYONE wants to do it.</p>
<p>And after everyone starts doing it, it is no longer “in”.  Because, c’mon ….everyone’s doing it.</p>
<p>So we will eventually be flooded with 1,000,000 online stores selling mugs and t-shirts with silly messages provided by GTP Chat.</p>
<p>It’s cool, everyone is doing it, so go follow the crowd.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnm71pmo">The Full Money</h3>
<p>Still, I suppose that most people will still want to find that magical easy way to make money with little to no effort. I suppose that there are ways to take Chat GPT (which is just a tool, by the way) and apply it to a <strong>new</strong> idea. If you are going to go this route, at least take a route that no one else is going.</p>
<p>I, for one, have applied ChatGPT to our toolbox and it now builds houses automatically. I’ve written a Python script to post the houses on the internet, so they just basically sell themselves.  :)</p>

                <div class="post__toc">
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#mcetoc_1hvnmsk5313">Choose a free password manager</a></li>

</div>
<p>It’s 2024 - if you are still using a basic password like <em>password1234</em> (shame on you) or using the same password for all your online accounts, you are just begging for a world of digital (and real-life) hurt.</p>
<p>It can be a bit intimidating for people to start using a password manager, but put simply: would you prefer to take a bit of time now to set up a small program you can use for free and anywhere, so your passwords are safe, or are you the type that prefers to call banks in a rush to cancel cards, send support emails to companies explaining you were hacked while waiting impatiently for a reply?  If you are the first group - read on!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5313">Choose a free password manager</h3>
<p>First you need to choose one. There are all sorts of free and paid options, but there are two options that are more than enough for your needs, and both are free:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a></li>
<li><a href="https://proton.me/pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton Pass</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice is yours - I had access to Bitwarden first so mainly use that. The design is a bit dated. Proton Pass, on the other hand, is much nicer to look at, but not as mature a product as Bitwarden. Anyways, choose one and install. Then, the next step is the most important:</p>
<h3>Create a strong master password</h3>
<p>A good password manager will require you set up a master password, to access the password manager. A good password manager will also NOT store your master password. As a result, should you lose or forget it, you will not be able to retrieve it or request the company send it to you. You also will not be able to generate a new one. So THIS password is one that will have to be a good one and also one that you can remember. (This is the step that will burn you later on if you don’t think about it for just a bit).</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5315">Import existing passwords</h3>
<p>If you have passwords saved in your browser, many free password managers allow you to import them. This is a good idea and will save time. Go for it!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5316">Automatically store new passwords</h3>
<p>Let the password manager automatically store new passwords when you log in. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnmsk5317">Create New Passwords</h3>
<p>Use the Password Manager to manually generate new passwords and also check if your password is found in a data breach. Some password managers, like Bitwarden, will let you easily set a password length (40, 50, even 100 characters). These will be passwords that you are likely unable to ever memorize. However, it isn’t necessary - as long as you remember the master password you set up in step #2, you’ll have access to it.  It also doesn’t matter what browser you use, as there is an extension that you can install and use on your computer, phone, etc.</p>
<p>Quick easy steps. In 2024 there is no excuse for using a poor password. You can take a small amount of time now to peacefully set up a password manager…. or a lot more (and stressful) time later on.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/34/naming-game-2.webp" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Presenting yourself on the internet can be rather complicated. Especially when you add the factor of a multilanguage website.  Domain name availability, the ability to pronounce / spell a name are all factors.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve put what I believe to be the final touches (for now, at least) on my personal website setup.  Originally, I went with one domain name and a subdomain for English speakers. It looked something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>elmikewalsh.com</li>
<li>en.elmikewalsh.com</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all fine and well…. In an English-speaking setting. No one would have problems spelling “mike”, “Walsh” is tough to screw up, and despite “el” being from Spanish, most English speakers would get the idea.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a Spanish-speaking content, it’s not so easy. Here’s the pitfalls I experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mike:</strong>  In Chile at least, you get “Maik”, “Maikol" or “Mike”.  So there’s a 1 in 3 chance that part will be spelled correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Walsh:</strong> Spanish (and other Romance languages) have a nice flow of consonants and vowels.  My last name does not. So about 100% of the time it is reduced to spelling it out.</li>
<li><strong>El: </strong>No problems in Spanish land with this one.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So, having to spell out m-i-k-e-w-a-l-s-h to share my domain name or email address sucks.  Especially by phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good test for choosing your name/email/whatever btw - if you can say it in a phone conversation and the other person can note it, you’re doing well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Here’s how I got around it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I have two separate domain names  - it’s as short as possible and only the extensions are different.</li>
<li>For Spanish speakers (and a slight search results boost by using a ccTLD) I can be found at - <a href="https://www.elmike.cl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elmike.cl</a></li>
<li>For the English version of my personal site I went with - elmike.me (you are here)</li>
<li>For personal email I went with the .me version, since .me works well in Spanish as well.  It’s also easier to say, as “cl” is unpronounceable and you end up saying each letter.</li>
<li>Also by eliminating my last name, a Spanish-speaker is just left with “mike”.  For the Spanish-speaker (Chilean) that can’t spell it (quite a few it seems) I can say, “Mike. Mee-Kay-con-Ka) and that will work 99% of the time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And for the other 1% electronic communication might be a whole different issue.</p>
<hr>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.elmikewalsh.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elmikewalsh.com</a> domain?  I put together a neat starry night landing/splash page with two photos of myself linked to the Spanish and English versions of my personal sites.</p>
<p>And that’s all I have to say about that.</p>

                <p>Quentin Tarantino recently remarked that he plans to make 10 movies, and that’s it. (note: in context, he did indicate that he would be fine doing something later on despite having done 10 movies, so it’s not a set-in-stone number). Mentioned wanting to go out at the top of his game.  Similar to some, but not all, athletes.  The same applies to everything; our “mere mortal” projects. Our jobs. Our ambitions. Our desire to make more, have more, obtain more, visit more, watch more, see more.</p>
<p><strong>At what point is it enough?</strong></p>
<p>Enough means the necessary to meet a need or desire. So once you reach that point, everything beyond that is extra. Unnecessary. Wasteful, even.</p>
<p><strong>Is the glass half full or half empty?</strong>  <em>(Is that even the correct question?)</em></p>
<p>There is a strong minimalism trend in a number of circles. You can find excesses in minimalism as well, as many try to do away with everything except the bare spartan essentials of life. In the design world, minimalism appears to mean “Only use black and white please. Hopefully only text.”.  But in some cases, enough means more than black and white.</p>
<p>There is an old adage to “take everything in moderation”. That is a fine way to avoid excesses, but then again, taking “everything in moderation” is in itself excessive. More than “enough” (so go crazy every once in a while). </p>
<p>It’s a good idea to stop every now and again to ask yourself, “What is enough?”  If not, you may never know when you’ve arrived.</p>

                <h3>Ongoing Spanish Translation For Publii CMS</h3>
<p>I have recently had multiple projects based on <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii CMS</a>. Publii is an amazing program that makes it easy to create and manage your website. The developer community has also provided a number of translations. However, one of Publii's previous limitations was the lack of a complete Spanish translation. So, I took it upon myself to fill in the blank.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/publii-trans-2-2xl.webp" alt="Two iMac screens with coding and Publii logo." width="1200" height="675" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/51/responsive/publii-trans-2-2xl-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Over the course of a month, I reviewed and translated more than 1,300 lines of code into Spanish, both for the main program and for the text editor (theme translations may come at a future date).</p>
<p>Once this was finished I submitted the merge request from my <a href="https://www.github.com/elmikewalsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, which was accepted at the start of the new year.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can click the button below to download the latest Spanish language pack for Publii CMS.</p>

<p>The translation of the code was completed in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sublime Text</a>.</p>

                <p>According to the Gregorian calendar, another year (2023) is coming to a close. That time of year where many people across the world enter the yearly commercialist furor and shop, shop, shop, eat, eat, eat and drink, drink, drink.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s get XYZ gifts for XYZ people. Person X is surely going to give us a gift, so we have to have one to gift back to Person X.</li>
<li>“The food has to be perfect.”</li>
<li>“The table has to be perfect.”</li>
<li>“Everything has to be perfect. Just like last year. Just like next year.”</li>
<li>“The tree has to be bigger than last year. More tree. More lights!”</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh my goodness, I have a headache and am stressed just writing this.  Pull the handbrake. Stop. Breathe. Relax. Step away from the stress machine and <strong>no. one. will. get. hurt.</strong></p>
<p>Take the time to stop, relax, look around, and enjoy. Let it go. Keep it simple. Go watch <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/a-charlie-brown-christmas/umc.cmc.mbxalimrwrtq72wj4h601pyf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday and live to tell about it.</p>

                <p>On Sunday, December 17, Chile will (again) go to the polls to vote on the new constitution proposal. In very very general political terms, while the first proposal a couple years back was seen as “leftist”, the new one has been prepared by a predominantly right-wing group. It is a simple vote: Do you approve of the new constitution?  Yes or No. Simple question. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to fuck it up, if you think about it (which, unfortunately, I have). So, here are 4 ways to fuck up a simple yes/no question:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Answer Unprepared:</strong> To vote on a new constitution, you need to read it. You can argue all you want about how it’s long, not everyone has the education level to understand it, etc. If you are reading this, you can read the constitution. Is it long?  Hell, yeah. Over 170 pages.  Is it really interesting?  Not so much.  But considering it is an overreaching document that serves as a sort of national guide for maybe at least 100 years, it might be important.  And considering how much time we spend on phones, on Netflix, on stuff that really isn’t essential to the day-to-day, it’s more irresponsibility or laziness that we don’t bother.  Even if you don’t read it all, at least read some parts. Maybe the ones you feel are the most important.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Someone Else’s Answer:</strong> Love this one. People all the time complain about how everyone is only interested in themselves and their own well-being; government is only interested in keeping power. But when it comes time to vote yes/no on a constitution, we open it, see how many pages it is, and resort to…. The opinions of other and/or the news. It hurts to think for myself, please think for me. My favorite is when people bitch and moan about how politicians are corrupt, then check to see what their favorite political party is going to vote. Lovely.</li>
<li><strong>Vote Based On Who Is President:</strong> This one is absurd. A constitution (democratically prepared) is larger than one (or several) administrations. Some people will vote in favor (or against) on Sunday based solely on who is currently president. The current president, by the way, has nothing to do with the new document. It’s a bit like saying, “The football team I hate uses blue uniforms, so I hate football.”</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Answer The Question:</strong> Annulling your vote for president or senator or what have you is one thing (still think those annulled votes should have some consequence). But this is a document that will be around for a while (if approved) so good to have an opinion. And also, not voting will expose you to a fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, we will have to see how this turns out on the weekend. I’m sure there are many other ways to fuck up a simple yes/no question, but you need to start somewhere. And now you know.</p>

                <p>I remember a past time, a golden time, when this interconnected space called the internet was a different place. It was a place to show who you were, unashamedly. GeoCities and MySpace existed (don’t miss them), Google did not. It was a place to build spaces and pages with primary colors, and behold the hideous ugliness that resulted and say, “I. Made. That.”  And it was created, for no other reason than to make something and maybe – just maybe – someone else would find it.</p>
<h3>That was then, this is now:</h3>
<p>The internet has largely transformed itself into the digital equivalent of a mall, where everyone wants to sell you something, or get you to subscribe to the latest trend.  All in all, it’s all the same as the next website, except “it’s our special take on it; subscribe to / buy our XYZ, not the other one”. Every website seems to have a pop-up window, and some try to block what you are looking for. Others are so full of advertisements and banners that you have to search to find what you were really looking for.</p>
<p>We got smart and installed ad-blockers. The websites, desperate for hits and money, punched back, sometimes forcing us to “disable” the ad blocker, as if what we were doing was….bad. (quick tip: love Safari – when the pop-up does not give you the option to close it, just hit the Reader Mode and it all goes away).   :)</p>
<p>When we go home (or wherever we live) we close the windows, turn off the lights, and leave the world outside. We then connect to our social media to upload photos of every single waking moment of our life (stopping to actually live that life, in order to better document it). What we are wearing (or not). What we are doing. Where we are doing it. With whom. It’s kinda the equivalent of living in a glass house, taking off all your clothes, taking out a megaphone and announcing to the world that the party is at your place.</p>
<p><strong>Ewwwww.</strong></p>
<p>I guess no one will really stop for a moment to actually think about what (and why) we do what we do when we connect. We’re too busy turning off our brains to do what we always do.</p>
<p>So many people are worried that AI will soon be smarter than humans and we should stop developing that technology. I’d say that humans are in such a rush to stupidify themselves that IA won’t have to overtake us at all – we’ll just dumb ourselves down until AI passes us by naturally.</p>

<p>In today's world, our virtual existence is like a fortress. Just like castles required fortifications for protection, so does your online presence. It may sound daunting, but don't worry, we've poked around the sage advice from the legendary Sun Tzu, master strategist, to help you strengthen your digital defenses without feeling like you're preparing for war.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnn0e9u1k">Know Your Board Game</h3>
<p>First and foremost, let's look at the importance of knowing the playing field. As Sun Tzu famously said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the digital realm as understanding your various platforms, being aware of where your sensitive information is stored, and identifying any potential vulnerabilities in your online setup. Where have you set up accounts, what information have you provided, how strong is your password, who has access, etc.</p>
<p>Defense is not the only factor at play here - being a sly li’l devil is equally important (in a positive sense, of course…usually…). Sun Tzu valued deceit, and the same principle applies in this situation. Be on your guard against deceptive emails attempting to extract your confidential information or entice you to click on dubious links. Adaptability is also crucial. The digital sphere is constantly evolving, so your defenses must evolve as well. Stay ahead by updating security settings, choosing strong passwords (please refrain from 'password123'), installing and using a password manager (<a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a> and <a href="https://proton.me/pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton Pass</a> are good), and implementing two-factor authentication for added security.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1hvnn0e9u1l">Ninja Up!</h3>
<p>Don't forget, safeguarding your data is only one piece of the puzzle; safeguarding your identity is just as crucial. Your digital persona warrants just as much caution and protection as your physical self. By delving into Sun Tzu's strategies, you're equipping yourself with the skills of a ninja - swift, elusive to threats, and fortified against any breaches (and ninjas are super cool, of course).</p>
<p>Armed with timeless wisdom and modern savvy, you'll be able to maneuver through the online realm like a seasoned pro, fortifying your virtual fortress against cyber intruders. It's like becoming your own personal cybersecurity hero without needing a superhero cape, and you can return to wearing your underwear under your pants (cough, cough, Superman, cough).</p>
