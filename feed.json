If you've made it this far, you can probably guess that my name is Mike (Michael) Walsh, and I am a real, live human being!</p>\n<p>I was born and raised in Westmont, Illinois in the noth-centeral part of the United States, for the first 30 or so years of my life.  During my time at the University, I also had the opportunity to spend 3 months in the south-central part of Chile, in a city called San Pedro de la Paz (Which is next to Concepción, an even larger city).</p>\n<p>This would prove to be a very important detail up until now in this story called life.</p>\n<p>While I was in the University, I also became fascinated with the World Wide Web. In the really early years - we're talking 1997 - I remember going to the basement of the dormitory where I lived and searching for \"How to create a website\" on the internet. Since I was a poor university student without money or credit cards, the only hosting I could access was ...*gasp*... <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\" alt=\"Wikipedia entry for GeoCities\" title=\"Wikipedia entry for GeoCities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GeoCities</a> (I hang my head in shame).</p>\n<p>Little by little, as the years passed by, I became more adept at designing, and coding. While everyone else was going out to the bars, I was taking my first steps in learning PHP...</p>\n<p>I also discovered that, once I learn how to do something, I thoroughly enjoy explaining (or enjoy explaining thoroughly.....) how it works to other people. This is where the \"pedagogical love\" part of my education comes in, I suppose.  Well, once the university part of life was over, it took a few years to figure out what (or where) I wanted to do this \"life\" thing. So I took the crazy decision to move to Chile.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>\"Down Under\" Sans Kangaroos</h3>\n<p>The actual process of moving to Chile was looooong. It involved sleeping (somewhat) in the Atlanta airport, discovering there was a small problem with my air ticket which almost left me stranded, and - of course - the 14-hour flight with all my possesions.</p>\n<p>But once I arrived in Chile, things got better quickly. I started working in an institue in the city of Chillán, which connected me to many wonderful people (including my wife). And 2 years later our child was born!  =)</p>\n<p>A strange turn of events led me to start working with <a href=\"https://www.teachingchile.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TeachingChile</a>, the company that provided me a foothold in Chile. I began by working freelance on periodic website updates, while also working some freelance work on the side under the name <a href=\"https://www.imaginalgo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Imaginalgo</a>. and joined the team at the start of 2012. This was my first taste of \"remote work\".  At the same time I wrapped up work at a language institute in Valdivia - to present it has been the last job I was required to \"go to\".</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Career Shift</h3>\n<p>I was soon sought out by another language institute which offered me the chance to teach classes via the internet - I continued with both of these remote jobs for the next several years.  In 2017 I began work with <a href=\"http://www.optuno.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optuno</a> as a Web Designer and later as a Project Manager, which I continue to enjoy to the present.</p>",

Many locations use the words <strong class=\"hq od\">Men</strong> and <strong class=\"hq od\">Women</strong>, taking all the mystery out of your decision-making process. But some places like to be ….creative in labeling the bathroom doors. Sometimes the symbols are clear, while other times…not so much. In one location, images of James Dean and Marilyn Monroe were used on the door. I suppose that represents <strong class=\"hq od\">Men</strong> and <strong class=\"hq od\">Women Do Your Business Here</strong>, and not <strong class=\"hq od\">Dead Famous People Hide Out Here</strong>.</p>\n<p id=\"ecd5\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nv ht nw nx ny nz oa ob oc ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In one location, I actually saw a rooster and hen as the bathroom symbols.

And, what is that little image to the left of the word English? Why, it’s a flag — a United States flag. “That’s great” you think, as you are navigating the website from your office in Canada.

You have been a fan of Manchester City all your life. And now, you have the fortune to visit a website that uses the name of your language and your flag in the language switcher. That’s wonderful. But, how many other people don’t have that luck? Let’s imagine the case of England, as mentioned in James Offer’s <a href=\"http://www.flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/why-flags-do-not-represent-language/\" class=\"bc co ic id ie if\"><em class=\"it\">Why flags do not represent languages</em></a>.

So, after all the English language originated, to a certain degree, from ….England.

Hey, That’s Not My Flag! (But I speak that stuff)</h2>\n<p id=\"beae\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr pt ht pu nx pv nz pw ob px ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">OK, what flag is more recognizable than the United States flag, right? Consider that, according to Offer, <em class=\"it\">“while the USA has far more English speakers than Britain, English does not originate from the United States.”</em></p>\n<p id=\"f93c\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nv ht nw nx ny nz oa ob oc ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Oh, and since you are from England, there is the possibility that you learned in your history class that the U.S. were “the colonies that got away.” Maybe you even feel bothered about it, and their silly “American” accents.</p>\n<p id=\"a073\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nv ht nw nx ny nz oa ob oc ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Good point? So, if you are from England, your flag isn’t a good idea because it isn’t so recognizable. And a U.S. flag isn’t so representative. But, it could be worse — let’s fly the Union Jack!</p>\n<h2 id=\"d952\" class=\"ph go dg bt bs di pi pj pk pl pm pn po pp pq pr ps\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">3. I Hate That Flag!</h2>\n<p id=\"a655\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr pt ht pu nx pv nz pw ob px ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So, since the flags of England and the United States don’t serve very well to accompany the word English in our language selector, let’s try the Union Jack. There’s a big problem with that, however. Let’s imagine you are a former colony of England/Great Britain/whatever. You surely aren’t going to be pleased to see the flag of the “former masters” as representative of your current language, right?</p>\n<p id=\"3e6f\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nv ht nw nx ny nz oa ob oc ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In closing, as so many others have said before me: flags represent <em class=\"it\">countries</em>, not languages. So unless you are targeting countries, <strong class=\"hq od\"><em class=\"it\">do not</em></strong> use their flags (No matter what the <a href=\"https://wpml.org/\" class=\"bc co ic id ie if\">WPML plugin for WordPress</a> suggests!).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"8f66\" class=\"ph go dg bt bs di pi pj pk pl pm pn po pp pq pr ps\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So What’s a Girl/Boy/Other To Do?</h2>\n<p id=\"42e9\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr pt ht pu nx pv nz pw ob px ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">That, my friend, is a really good question. The simplest answer, of course, would be to not use any country’s flag.

Andrey Mima, in the article, <a href=\"https://coderwall.com/p/knyvug/using-flag-in-language-selector-is-still-okay\" class=\"bc co ic id ie if\"><em class=\"it\">Using flag in language selector is still okay</em></a><em class=\"it\">, </em>acknowledges that flags really aren’t a good combination for languages in a selector. He continues by showing a screenshot of Twitter’s homepage, with the text completely displayed using Chinese characters. The argument is that</p>\n<blockquote class=\"qq qr qs\">\n<p id=\"daf6\" class=\"ho hp dg it hq b hr nv ht nw nx ny nz oa ob oc ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“How do you find the language selector in order to switch the language?

And flags don’t match languages, so there are no flags.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a7dd\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nv ht nw nx ny nz oa ob oc ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">OK, good point. If you can’t find the language switcher, you can’t switch the language. But, this only shows that a language switcher needs some sort of visual representation to draw attention to it. This doesn’t necessarily mean it should be a country’s flag. So, what other options are there?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"0fde\" class=\"ph go dg bt bs di pi pj pk pl pm pn po pp pq pr ps\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">A Flag by Any Other Name…</h2>\n<p id=\"9f29\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr pt ht pu nx pv nz pw ob px ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The great minds behind international language standards and design (who are far more intelligent that I am) came up with a possible icon to use in such situations.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/11/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/11/responsive/3-xs.webp 300w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/11/responsive/3-sm.webp 480w ,https://en.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/11/responsive/3-md.webp 768w\">\n<figcaption >Language Icon: <a href=\"http://www.languageicon.org/\" class=\"bc co ic id ie if\">http://www.languageicon.org</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr pt ht pu nx pv nz pw ob px ib align-left\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s a ….<em class=\"it\">nice</em> icon, but just doesn’t seem to get the job done for me.
