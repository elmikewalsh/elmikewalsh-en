            "title": "Defending Your Cybercastle: Digital Art of War",
            "content_html": "<p>In today's world, our virtual existence is like a fortress. Just like castles required fortifications for protection, so does your online presence. It may sound daunting, but don't worry, we've poked around the sage advice from the legendary Sun Tzu, master strategist, to help you strengthen your digital defenses without feeling like you're preparing for war.</p>\n<h3>Know Your Board Game</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, let's look at the importance of knowing the playing field. As Sun Tzu famously said, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the digital realm as understanding your various platforms, being aware of where your sensitive information is stored, and identifying any potential vulnerabilities in your online setup. Where have you set up accounts, what information have you provided, how strong is your password, who has access, etc.</p>\n<p>Defense is not the only factor at play here - being a sly li’l devil is equally important (in a positive sense, of course…usually…). Sun Tzu valued deceit, and the same principle applies in this situation. Be on your guard against deceptive emails attempting to extract your confidential information or entice you to click on dubious links. Adaptability is also crucial. The digital sphere is constantly evolving, so your defenses must evolve as well. Stay ahead by updating security settings, choosing strong passwords (please refrain from 'password123'), installing and using a password manager (<a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitwarden</a> and <a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proton Pass</a> are good), and implementing two-factor authentication for added security.</p>\n<h3>Ninja Up!</h3>\n<p>Don't forget, safeguarding your data is only one piece of the puzzle; safeguarding your identity is just as crucial. Your digital persona warrants just as much caution and protection as your physical self. By delving into Sun Tzu's strategies, you're equipping yourself with the skills of a ninja - swift, elusive to threats, and fortified against any breaches (and ninjas are super cool, of course).</p>\n<p>Armed with timeless wisdom and modern savvy, you'll be able to maneuver through the online realm like a seasoned pro, fortifying your virtual fortress against cyber intruders. It's like becoming your own personal cybersecurity hero without needing a superhero cape, and you can return to wearing your underwear under your pants (cough, cough, Superman, cough).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Photo used:</strong> <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/terracotta-army-china-xian-soldier-1865006/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pixabay.com/photos/terracotta-army-china-xian-soldier-1865006/</a></p>",

            "title": "Privacy: A Primer",
            "content_html": "<p>Privacy is a hot topic in 2023. A concern for some, a buzzword for others. Should I care? What can I do? Is it too late? Why bother?</p>\n<p>I’d love to say this is your one-stop shop for all the answers, but who am I but one set of hands typing? (Disclaimer: In 2023, this website uses ancient technology – I am a human writing this article from scratch; no Artificial Intelligence added).</p>\n<p><strong>But some musings on privacy, for what they may be worth:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Privacy is one of those things that you don’t realize you have (or are losing) until you start to lose it (or no longer have it). Then you value it. And it is by that time too difficult to get it back.</li>\n<li>A completely different topic (Artificial Intelligence) is in large part our willingness to have signed up for and used online storage, free online photos (Google Photos, for example) and any other service offering too-good-to-be-free storage and functionality. Or is it just a coincidence that many of these “free” services used people as the product and then turned to paid plans right before the start of the big AI boom? Who cares about privacy or what can happen – just sign me up for my free photo storage!</li>\n<li>Many consider privacy “too difficult” a topic, requiring work and effort to attend to, and will definitely be interested “later”. I imagine living in a glass house, walking around naked all day, unconcerned that anyone passing by can shoot photos and videos of you now, because later down the road you will invest in curtains and that will just solve the entire problem then and there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what can be done about privacy (online, at least)? Well, this does not at all aim to be a comprehensive primer on protecting yourself online. Just a small list of ideas and possible solutions / services. I’m not affiliated with any of them, and I get nothing by you clicking any links here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email:</strong> Well, it seems like everyone has their Gmail. Sign up, free space. Free photos. Free collaboration. Free, free, free. Until it isn’t. Sign in to any website easy with your Gmail. They can’t read your email. That’s what they say. And you can simply use Google to search for evidence of that. Remember, they are a business, and they have a bottom line. You might consider more private email options such as <a href=\"https://proton.me/mail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ProtonMail</a>, <a href=\"https://skiff.com/mail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skiff Mail</a> or <a href=\"https://postale.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">postale.io</a>. Email (or any service) is only as private as the laws of the country in which the service resides, and it is best to consider the allies / strategic partners of foreign countries (consider searching for things like “Five Eyes” and other related terms. Not on Google. Or in their browser. Go for something private.</li>\n<li><strong>Search:</strong> If you type it into a Google search engine, the world knows it. And don’t fool yourself into thinking that “Private / Incognito” means no one knows. Consider using a search engine that does not track you and your every keystroke, such as <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href=\"https://www.startpage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Startpage</a> (which uses Google results but strips the tracking info).</li>\n<li><strong>Photos:</strong> Google makes money selling advertising. Your information. So the more info they collect on you, the more money they can make. Use any other service. Am I saying that OneDrive or iCloud are private? Hell, no. Does Apple (currently) have a business model of selling advertising to anyone in the universe? No.  So, while it might not be an ideal solution, consider that convenience has a price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most websites will also use Google Analytics to track you, because companies / sites are obsessed with seeing how much traffic they receive.  This website, by the way, has no tracking or analytics installed. I don’t care. There is a method of contact indicated on this website; if you are interested in it, you will find it easily enough.</p>\n<p>Well, those are the musings of the moment. Hope it is of some help to someone!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Photo used:</strong> <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/es/fotos/camaras-de-seguridad-de-varios-colores-LfaN1gswV5c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://unsplash.com/es/fotos/camaras-de-seguridad-de-varios-colores-LfaN1gswV5c</a></p>",

He is content with what he has and not what he is lacks; he tends to his garden and trucks around his tiny nation in an old (1987) Volkswagen Beetle.</p>\n<p>So, in this acrid environment, full of controversy, scandal and uncertainty, it is necessary, I think, to pause, take a step back and see things — life included — from a different angle.</p>\n<p>The world is not a place always filled with flowers and optimism, but neither is it perpetually the inverse.

Your experience should be modified to fit your reality. I am often tasked with sending out a newsletter or survey. The list of recipients arrives in the form of an Excel document. If I am fortunate, the document is relatively tidy and there are no spelling errors (one can dream). But, in almost all cases, the information comes in two columns — one with the email addresses, and one with the first and last name(s).</p>\n<p id=\"1d07\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The problem? Programs and sites like <a href=\"http://www.mailchimp.com/\" class=\"bc co ic id ie if\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mailchimp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/\" class=\"bc co ic id ie if\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Surveymonkey</a> allow you great personalization of your emails, allowing you to target and use things like the recipient’s first name, last name, or other data, but <strong class=\"hq oy\"><em class=\"oz\">only if it is in its own column</em></strong>.</p>\n<p id=\"8cc3\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So, how can we clean up our first/last name problem without cutting and pasting all day?

First, we want to make sure that the first and last names are all in one nice and near column.

Then, we paste the copied columns into two different, empty columns, (it doesn’t matter which columns you paste into). However, we don’t want to paste using CTRL + V. Instead, right-click and you will see multiple paste options. Select the icon that has a 123 at the bottom. This is called <strong class=\"hq oy\">Paste as Values</strong>. If you do this, you are separating the First/Last Names from the formulas, and can freely cut and paste them wherever you want in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"88cb\" class=\"ho hp dg bt hq b hr nk ht nl nm nn no np nq nr ib\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Well, that’s all here.
