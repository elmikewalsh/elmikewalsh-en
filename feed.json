The plan here is install WordPress in an offline environment, develop our website, with all the designs, posts, pages and plugins that you like, and then “export it” as a static website using a WordPress plugin. Since my original article in 2016, a lot has changed; WordPress has grown, and there is a new plugin to streamline this process. </p>\n<p>This is an update of <a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/wordpress-my-favorite-static-site-generator/\">the process I wrote about waaaaay back in 2016</a>, which apparently got a fair amount of attention. Here’s we’ll look at some updated steps to make the process more modern and streamlined, as well as discover a great place to get some free WordPress themes.</p>\n<p>You will want to have the following to complete this process</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A website idea</li>\n<li>Website content (text, images, etc., ready to add into your WordPress website)</li>\n<li>An internet connection</li>\n<li>A computer (Mac, Linux, Windows)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2ckag3mp\">Why Would Anyone Do This?</h3>\n<p>Each person has their specific way of doing things. A particular process. A unique workflow. There are probably people who would ask me, “Why would you use WordPress to generate static websites? Couldn’t you just use an already existing static site generator?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In fact, in 2024, I would personally recommend using <a href=\"https://www.getpublii.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii CMS</a>. It is amazing! (they don't pay me to say that. They don't even know).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I know many, many, many people use WordPress and have too much time and work invested in that platform. That in itself is a reason to do this. So if you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Really comfortable with WordPress, but don’t have the time to learn another system, just to create a static website.</li>\n<li>You have a client who has a WordPress theme, or insists on using WordPress and simply wants the fastest website possible.</li>\n<li>Just prefer to use WordPress for whatever reason, but are interested in making your website faster and safer...</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This may be of interest to you.</strong></p>\n<p>There are also some more convincing reasons. Such as this: <strong>Security</strong>. <a href=\"https://bloggerspassion.com/wordpress-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress, as of May 2024, powers over 43% of all websites in the world</a>. That makes WordPress a huge target for hackers, scammers, and the lot. And even if you keep your WordPress installation up-to-date, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/almost-a-million-wordpress-websites-at-risk-from-this-security-flaw-heres-what-you-need-to-know-to-keep-your-site-safe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a forgotten or deactivated plugin on your website could create an accidental “back door”</a> for hackers to take over and cause havoc.</p>\n<p>What if you could create a website using WordPress on your computer, and then publish it as a static website? And by doing so you eliminate many of the security issues inherent in with databases, non-updated themes, software and plugins? And, as a bonus, your site is FAST?</p>\n<p><strong>Yes. You can.</strong> </p>\n<p>If you want to know how, read on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2ckag3mq\">What We’ll Do / What You'll Need</h3>\n<p>Here you’ll get a good step-by-step on how to set up a local server and install WordPress (the process is muuuuuch easier today). From there, you will add your content, design, layout, etc. (this is not a design article – that part is all you).</p>\n<p>Once you finish setting up your website in WordPress and are at the point where you would “publish” it for the world to see….. that’s where we will change gears. We will upload this static website to the internet (using FTP or whatever you like).</p>\n<p>As a bonus, in a follow-up article I will share with you a play-by-play on how to export your website to GitHub. (you can set up a simple website on GitHub for free, provided it isn’t super high traffic or requiring advanced scripting). </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Before you invest your valuable time reading, take note of the following:</strong></span></p>\n<p>This article might not be for you if the following is true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you don’t use WordPress…</li>\n<li>If you don’t know how to install WordPress…</li>\n<li>If you desire to have your visitors leave comments (using the WordPress comment feature)…</li>\n<li>If you require real-time, dynamic areas on your website…</li>\n<li>If you aren’t creating a website…</li>\n<li>If you don’t have internet…</li>\n<li>If you are looking for an advanced eCommerce website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this is the case, I'll understand if you drift off to some other place. (but this article might be of use to someone you know - so please share it).</p>\n<p>Ready to begin? Let's go!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2ckelai1g\">Step 1: Download LocalWP</h3>\n<p>Ok so in order to install WordPress on our computer without moving it to a server, we need to setup a “server” on our computer. Previously we used a program called XAMPP, which is a bit technical and overkill for what we want to do. </p>\n<p>For this process, we are going to download <a href=\"https://localwp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LocalWP</a>. There are other options available to set up WordPress offline (such as XAMPP and Studio by WordPress). However, XAMPP is more technical and overkill for what we want to do. And Studio is not currently compatible with the Staatic WP Plugin which we will use to create our static Wordpress site. So head on over to LocalWP and click the download button.</p>\n<p>You will need to choose your platform and enter some information. You can enter whatever info you like, including for the email address. Once submitted, you will be able to download the program.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/1-2.jpg\" alt=\"LocalWP download screen requesting basic info\" width=\"604\" height=\"666\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/1-2-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2uqaroqm\">Step 2: Set Up LocalWP</h3>\n<p>Once you have finished installing the program, you will see options to <strong>Create a New Site</strong> (default option), <strong>Create From a Blueprint</strong> or <strong>Select an Existing ZIP</strong>. Choose the CREATE A NEW SITE option and then CONTINUE.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"LocalWP set up screen to create a new website.\" width=\"2372\" height=\"1584\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/2-2-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>You will then see screens asking you to NAME YOUR WEBSITE, choose your SITE ENVIRONMENT and SET UP WORDPRESS. On the final screen you will set your WordPress username, password and email (if you want). In the ADVANCED OPTIONS below, you can click that and indicate if this is a MultiSite installation. Once you are ready, click the ADD SITE button.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/3.jpg\" data-size=\"1192x798\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/3-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"LocalWP screen asking to name website\" width=\"720\" height=\"482\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/4.jpg\" data-size=\"1198x798\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/4-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"LocalWP screen asking to choose server environment\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/5.jpg\" data-size=\"1194x794\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/gallery/5-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"LocalWP screen asking to set up WordPress credentials\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>After the setup is complete, you will see the following screen. Note the WP Admin button - you'll next want to click that button to login to your website. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/6.jpg\" alt=\"Screen in LocalWP that shows once site is set up.\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>However, first, please make this small but important change. You will want to change your web server to APACHE in the following section, then click the APPLY text that appears:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/pre-6.jpg\" alt=\"Change LocalWP server to Apache.\" width=\"1182\" height=\"789\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/pre-6-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2uqe85f10\">Step 3: Update Permalinks</h3>\n<p>You will need to go to the permalinks section of your WP admin and choose an option other than the default. The Staatic WP Plugin will not work if you use the default permalinks.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/8.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress admin screen showing location of Permalinks\" width=\"655\" height=\"435\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/8-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2ckddrj1a\">Step 4: Install Staatic - Static Site Generator</h3>\n<p>We are going to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/staatic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Staatic Site Generator WP Plugin</a> here to complete the setup of our process. You could complicate life by doing this manually, but since we just installed WordPress and have an internet connection, just follow the steps below.</p>\n<p>First we want to go to the Admin section of our website. So click the WP Admin link, which you should see here:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/7.jpg\" alt=\"Local WP - Screenshot with link to WP Admin\" width=\"1190\" height=\"793\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>This will open up in a new browser window. From here, go to the PLUGINS sections and select ADD NEW PLUGIN</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/4.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress backend and where to add Plugins\" width=\"1540\" height=\"915\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/4-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>On the new screen type STAATIC (note the spelling) and the following should appear. Click the INSTALL NOW button. Once completed, click the ACTIVATE button that appears.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/5.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot showing how to install Staatic Static Site WordPress Plugin\" width=\"1629\" height=\"661\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/5-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2ckddrj1a\">Step 5: Staatic Static Site Generator Options</h3>\n<p>From here the plugin is pretty simple, but there are a couple of options that may be important to you:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/6-2.jpg\" alt=\"Staatic Site plugin Deployment options.\" width=\"1113\" height=\"339\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/6-2-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Destination URL:</strong> The plugin recommends an absolute URL. This means that, ideally, you know what your full website address will be (for example: <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a>). In that case, you enter that here and save.  If not, or if you plan on using this on different websites, leave the default option as-is.</p>\n<p>For now, set it to OFFLINE URL, so once we Publish this site we can actually open it offline and view it.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/7-2.jpg\" alt=\"Staatic Site plugin Deployment location options.\" width=\"1054\" height=\"654\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/7-2-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Deployment Method (on the DEPLOYMENT tab):</strong> These are the options on how and where you would like to generate your new static website. By default LOCAL DIRECTORY is selected, meaning the plugin will create your new static website in a folder on your computer, and then you move it where you want to. However, there are other options to deploy (publish) directly to the internet. In a future article we will take a look at how to publish your website to GitHub. For now, if you don’t have a specific deployment destination, just leave it as LOCAL DIRECTORY.</p>\n<p><strong>Target Directory:</strong> Directly related to the option above. This is where your static website copy will be created on your computer. You may want to note this - or change it - so you aren't hunting for your new static website on your computer later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2ckddrj1a\">Step 6: Generate Your Website</h3>\n<p>Ok we've made it to the last step - once you are ready with your website, you can click on the STAATIC option in the WP Admin, and click the second link - Publications. On the new screen that appears, click the PUBLISH NOW button.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/9.jpg\" alt=\"Publishing screen in the Staatic WP plugin.\" width=\"1086\" height=\"586\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/9-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>If all goes according to plan, you should see a series of information after the process is complete (it will surely look different than the following screen).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/10.jpg\" alt=\"Staatic WP Plugin successfully deploying your website.\" width=\"1767\" height=\"994\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/10-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>If there are no errors, you should be all set! You can click on the RESOURCES tab (see image above) or the DOWNLOAD link in the following image to download your new website.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/11.jpg\" alt=\"Download your new static WordPress website.\" width=\"1764\" height=\"710\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-xs.webp 300w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-sm.webp 480w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-md.webp 768w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-lg.webp 1024w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-xl.webp 1360w ,https://www.elmikewalsh.com/media/posts/57/responsive/11-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you for making it this far! I hope this guide was useful. In a follow-up article I will show you how to deploy that new static website directly to GitHub, so you can have a simple, fast, safe and free (hosting) website!</p>\n<p><strong>Photo Used:</strong> <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/wordpress-cms-1810453/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pixabay.com</a></p>",

It's very important to <a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/defending-your-cybercastle-digital-art-of-war/\">defend your cybercastle</a> (pardon the ridiculous illustration) from people who like to stick their fingers where they don't belong.</p>\n<p>Password managers offer a secure solution by generating complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts, reducing the risk of using easily guessed or reused passwords across multiple sites. This practice not only strengthens personal security but also shields against credential stuffing attacks, where hackers use compromised passwords from one site to access others (which is a complex way of saying that if hackers get your password from one data breach, they can try all your accounts, in case you use the same password everywhere).</p>\n<p>As we open accounts and use services on more and more sites, maintaining a consistent level of security becomes challenging without a password manager. These tools not only store passwords securely but also simplify the login process across different devices, enhancing both convenience and security. By centralizing password management, users can focus on their activities online without the constant worry of remembering or securing multiple passwords manually.</p>\n<p>I was, like you, hesitant to start, thinking that it would be difficult, complicated and a lot of work (and I like tech stuff). I went with <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitwarden</a> because it had great reviews AND …..it was (and is) free. If you like this, you can <a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com/not-my-faultapp-default/\">check out a list of other software / services I recommend</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrs\">Getting Started with Bitwarden: Your First Password Manager</h3>\n<p>Ok, so you’re considering setting up this complex and terrifying “password manager”.  Before we begin, it might help to simplify the idea of a “password manager” a bit. Imagine that over the course of your day you had to unlock 40 doors with physical keys. Each key if different. And good thing; if all 40 locks used the same key, you could imagine what would happen if you lost one, right?</p>\n<p>Using the same password on your email, bank, social media, Netflix account, etc, is like using one physical key to open all your locks. Good luck to you if you lose your key or someone steals it to make themselves a copy.</p>\n<p>What if you had a small piece of FREE software that you could use anywhere you went (your browser – you like Firefox? Prefer Safari?  Browse with Brave? Opera?  Chrome (ewwww) – this software is available for all those browsers. Doesn’t matter if you use Windows, Mac, even Linux. Android phone? Check. iPhone? Check.</p>\n<p>Bitwarden is one such program. (there are others, but we’re looking at this one).</p>\n<p>What if, using this FREE software, you could create just ONE safe complex password and only have to remember that one password. Because once you open your Bitwarden with that password, all your other passwords are safely waiting inside. And those passwords could be super safe and super long. (Maybe 30, 40, 60 characters long; a hideous mix of letters, numbers, capitalization, etc). You wouldn’t ever have to think of a new and safe password again, because the program automatically generates one for you.</p>\n<p>Bitwarden does that. Interested? This takes a bit of time to set up, but once complete, you’re good to go. I took the leap. Take a little to get used to it.  But it’s soooooo much better.  Follow along:</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrt\">Step 1: Visit the Bitwarden Website</h3>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitwarden's official website</a>. You can poke around and learn about the product, the company, etc. But we’re here for the free software, so let’s continue….</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7olru\">Step 2: Download the Software</h3>\n<p>Once on the Bitwarden homepage, click on the “Download” button in the top navigation bar. You’ll be taken to a page with various download options. Bitwarden is available on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Choose the platform that suits your needs and follow the instructions to download the app.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you’re using Windows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the “Windows” icon.</li>\n<li>The download will start automatically.</li>\n<li>Once the download is complete, open the installer file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Bitwarden on your computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7olrv\">Step 3: Create Your Account</h3>\n<p>After installing Bitwarden, open the application. You’ll be prompted to create an account. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the “Create Account” button.</li>\n<li>Fill in your email address, a strong master password, and your name. Make sure your master password is something you can remember but also something that’s hard for others to guess. Bitwarden will help you gauge the strength of your password.</li>\n<li>Confirm your password and click “Submit”.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A super super important note at this step that I’ll repeat a few times – make sure your MASTER PASSWORD is something you will remember easily. Part of the reason Bitwarden is so secure is that they do not know your password. They don’t have access and they can’t send you a link to reset it. You can change the password later, but you will need to know the current password. Your master password cannot be recovered if you forget it! <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><strong>So if you forget your MASTER PASSWORD, you’re screwed; you can’t get in, you can’t recover your password.</strong></span> Please make sure you choose a MASTER PASSWORD you will remember. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS STEP!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols0\">Step 4: Verify Your Email</h3>\n<p>Bitwarden will send a verification email to the address you provided. Check your inbox and click on the verification link in the email. This step is crucial for securing your account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols1\">Step 5: Log In and Set Up Your Vault</h3>\n<p>With your account verified, log in to Bitwarden with your email and master password. You’ll now enter your vault, the secure place where all your passwords will be stored.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols2\">Step 6: Add Your First Item</h3>\n<p>To add your first password:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the “+” button or the “Add Item” button.</li>\n<li>You’ll be prompted to enter the name of the item (e.g., Gmail, Facebook), the username, and the password. If you don’t have a strong password yet, Bitwarden can generate one for you. Just click on the “Generate” button and a strong, random password will be created.</li>\n<li>Once you’ve filled in the details, click “Save”.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols3\">Step 7: Organize Your Vault</h3>\n<p>As you add more items, you might want to organize them into folders. This makes it easier to find specific passwords later on. To create a folder:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on “Folders” in the sidebar.</li>\n<li>Click “Add Folder”.</li>\n<li>Name your folder and click “Save”.</li>\n<li>You can now move items into this folder by editing the item and selecting the folder from the dropdown menu.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols4\">Step 8: Install Browser Extensions</h3>\n<p>Bitwarden offers browser extensions for Chrome (ewww), Firefox, Safari, Edge, and more. These extensions allow you to autofill passwords directly from your vault, making logging in to websites a breeze.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go back to the Bitwarden download page and select your browser.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions to add the extension.</li>\n<li>Once installed, log in to the extension with your Bitwarden account.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols5\">Step 9: Import Existing Passwords</h3>\n<p>If you’ve been storing passwords in your browser or another password manager, you can import them into Bitwarden. Here’s how:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Export your passwords from your current manager. This is usually found in the settings or options menu under “Export”.</li>\n<li>In Bitwarden, click on “Tools” and then “Import Data”.</li>\n<li>Select the format of your exported file and upload it to Bitwarden.</li>\n<li>Click “Import” and all your passwords will be added to your vault.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols6\">Step 10: Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3>\n<p>For an extra layer of security, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Bitwarden account.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to “Settings” in your Bitwarden account.</li>\n<li>Click on “Two-step Login”.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions to set up 2FA using an app like Google Authenticator or Authy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols7\">Step 11: Sync Across Devices</h3>\n<p>Make sure your passwords are available on all your devices. Install Bitwarden on your phone and log in with your account. Your vault will sync automatically, ensuring you have access to your passwords wherever you go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols8\">Step 12: Explore Advanced Features</h3>\n<p>Bitwarden offers many advanced features such as secure notes, password sharing, and encrypted file storage. While these, and other paid offerings, are not at all necessary, you can certainly see if you like what they offer. If Bitwarden is not your cup of tea, I could also recommend <a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proton Pass</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1i2a0d7ols9\">You Did It!</h3>\n<p>Congratulations! You’ve now set up Bitwarden, and can generate super long, secure passwords that are different for all your websites – and you only need to remember that one MASTER PASSWORD...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make sure your MASTER PASSWORD is something you will remember easily. Part of the reason Bitwarden is so secure is that they do not know your password. They don’t have access and they can’t send you a link to reset it. You can change the password later, but you will need to know the current password. Your master password cannot be recovered if you forget it! <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><strong>So if you forget your MASTER PASSWORD, you’re screwed; you can’t get in, you can’t recover your password.</strong></span> Please make sure you choose a MASTER PASSWORD you will remember.

In your social media feeds (if you do that still).  AI is the digital magic wand that will make all your dreams come true: construct your code, paint your pictures and write your articles.  Or, at least, in some cases it will write your articles. In other cases, it will simply steal them from people who already wrote them (do people still write things on the internet?)</p>\n<h3>How Confusing: Perplexity</h3>\n<p>In case you haven’t heard, the latest scandal involves the company Perplexity, which, in summary, was caught copying articles that were not theirs and not attributing the source of the articles. I won’t summarize, as the company is not worth the time. You can catch up on it here. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations</a></p>\n<p>In summary, it is the digital equivalent of going to a store, shoplifting a product, changing the label, and selling it in your store.  Amazing business model! Why didn’t anyone think of that before.</p>\n<h3>Old School Accreditation</h3>\n<p>Being a bit older, I am reminded of famous musical acts such as Milli Vanilli (side note: tragic story. search for it on the internet. You might even find an original journalistic note, rather than regurgitated AI tripe). Or just click here - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli</a></p>\n<p>Why is Milli Vanilli famous?  Mainly for supposedly singing when they weren’t.</p>\n<p>Back in the day, claiming something was yours when it wasn’t was not well received.</p>\n<p>Today, however, it is apparently a very successful business model.</p>\n<p>I remember back in school if you turned in an assignment without attributing your sources, you received a 0.</p>\n<p>Maybe that should remain the model to follow?</p>\n<p><strong>Photo Used:</strong> <span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/internet-copyright-protection-1013675/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pixabay.com</a></span></p>",

Because…why not, right?</p>\n<p>It seems that everyone has written an article about this amazing miracle, which seems to involve buying stock designs, having ChatGPT spit out silly messages, and automating t-shirt/product creation.  Then they just sell themselves, right?</p>\n<p>I do ask myself, “Self, if everyone has economic issues at this point ….who the hell is buying this stuff?!?</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hvnm71pmn\">The Full House</h3>\n<p>Now, in theory, the articles describe an interesting process on how to make money. And, unless the authors just made it up (which is also possible), then it makes money for someone.</p>\n<p>But, as is the case with anything “in”, once someone sees that XYZ is a success, then EVERYONE wants to do it.</p>\n<p>And after everyone starts doing it, it is no longer “in”.  Because, c’mon ….everyone’s doing it.</p>\n<p>So we will eventually be flooded with 1,000,000 online stores selling mugs and t-shirts with silly messages provided by GTP Chat.</p>\n<p>It’s cool, everyone is doing it, so go follow the crowd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hvnm71pmo\">The Full Money</h3>\n<p>Still, I suppose that most people will still want to find that magical easy way to make money with little to no effort. I suppose that there are ways to take Chat GPT (which is just a tool, by the way) and apply it to a <strong>new</strong> idea. If you are going to go this route, at least take a route that no one else is going.</p>\n<p>I, for one, have applied ChatGPT to our toolbox and it now builds houses automatically. I’ve written a Python script to post the houses on the internet, so they just basically sell themselves.  :)</p>\n<p><strong>Photo Used:</strong> <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-gray-metal-pipe-8pgK7WMSnXs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unsplash.com</a></p>",

There are all sorts of free and paid options, but there are two options that are more than enough for your needs, and both are free:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitwarden</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proton Pass</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The choice is yours - I had access to Bitwarden first so mainly use that. The design is a bit dated. Proton Pass, on the other hand, is much nicer to look at, but not as mature a product as Bitwarden. Anyways, choose one and install. Then, the next step is the most important:</p>\n<h3>Create a strong master password</h3>\n<p>A good password manager will require you set up a master password, to access the password manager. A good password manager will also NOT store your master password. As a result, should you lose or forget it, you will not be able to retrieve it or request the company send it to you. You also will not be able to generate a new one. So THIS password is one that will have to be a good one and also one that you can remember. (This is the step that will burn you later on if you don’t think about it for just a bit).</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hvnmsk5315\">Import existing passwords</h3>\n<p>If you have passwords saved in your browser, many free password managers allow you to import them. This is a good idea and will save time. Go for it!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hvnmsk5316\">Automatically store new passwords</h3>\n<p>Let the password manager automatically store new passwords when you log in. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hvnmsk5317\">Create New Passwords</h3>\n<p>Use the Password Manager to manually generate new passwords and also check if your password is found in a data breach. Some password managers, like Bitwarden, will let you easily set a password length (40, 50, even 100 characters). These will be passwords that you are likely unable to ever memorize. However, it isn’t necessary - as long as you remember the master password you set up in step #2, you’ll have access to it.  It also doesn’t matter what browser you use, as there is an extension that you can install and use on your computer, phone, etc.</p>\n<p>Quick easy steps. In 2024 there is no excuse for using a poor password. You can take a small amount of time now to peacefully set up a password manager…. or a lot more (and stressful) time later on.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Photo used:</strong> <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/security-professional-secret-5199236/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pixabay.com</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Presenting yourself on the internet can be rather complicated. Especially when you add the factor of a multilanguage website.  Domain name availability, the ability to pronounce / spell a name are all factors.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve put what I believe to be the final touches (for now, at least) on my personal website setup.  Originally, I went with one domain name and a subdomain for English speakers. It looked something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>elmikewalsh.com</li>\n<li>en.elmikewalsh.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all fine and well…. In an English-speaking setting. No one would have problems spelling “mike”, “Walsh” is tough to screw up, and despite “el” being from Spanish, most English speakers would get the idea.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in a Spanish-speaking content, it’s not so easy. Here’s the pitfalls I experienced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mike:</strong>  In Chile at least, you get “Maik”, “Maikol\" or “Mike”.  So there’s a 1 in 3 chance that part will be spelled correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Walsh:</strong> Spanish (and other Romance languages) have a nice flow of consonants and vowels.  My last name does not. So about 100% of the time it is reduced to spelling it out.</li>\n<li><strong>El: </strong>No problems in Spanish land with this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>So, having to spell out m-i-k-e-w-a-l-s-h to share my domain name or email address sucks.  Especially by phone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good test for choosing your name/email/whatever btw - if you can say it in a phone conversation and the other person can note it, you’re doing well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Here’s how I got around it:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have two separate domain names  - it’s as short as possible and only the extensions are different.</li>\n<li>For Spanish speakers (and a slight search results boost by using a ccTLD) I can be found at - <a href=\"https://www.elmike.cl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elmike.cl</a></li>\n<li>For the English version of my personal site I went with - elmike.me (you are here)</li>\n<li>For personal email I went with the .me version, since .me works well in Spanish as well.  It’s also easier to say, as “cl” is unpronounceable and you end up saying each letter.</li>\n<li>Also by eliminating my last name, a Spanish-speaker is just left with “mike”.  For the Spanish-speaker (Chilean) that can’t spell it (quite a few it seems) I can say, “Mike. Mee-Kay-con-Ka) and that will work 99% of the time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And for the other 1% electronic communication might be a whole different issue.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The original <a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elmikewalsh.com</a> domain?  I put together a neat starry night landing/splash page with two photos of myself linked to the Spanish and English versions of my personal sites.</p>\n<p>And that’s all I have to say about that.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Quentin Tarantino recently remarked that he plans to make 10 movies, and that’s it. (note: in context, he did indicate that he would be fine doing something later on despite having done 10 movies, so it’s not a set-in-stone number). Mentioned wanting to go out at the top of his game.  Similar to some, but not all, athletes.  The same applies to everything; our “mere mortal” projects. Our jobs. Our ambitions. Our desire to make more, have more, obtain more, visit more, watch more, see more.</p>\n<p><strong>At what point is it enough?</strong></p>\n<p>Enough means the necessary to meet a need or desire. So once you reach that point, everything beyond that is extra. Unnecessary. Wasteful, even.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the glass half full or half empty?</strong>  <em>(Is that even the correct question?)</em></p>\n<p>There is a strong minimalism trend in a number of circles. You can find excesses in minimalism as well, as many try to do away with everything except the bare spartan essentials of life. In the design world, minimalism appears to mean “Only use black and white please. Hopefully only text.”.  But in some cases, enough means more than black and white.</p>\n<p>There is an old adage to “take everything in moderation”. That is a fine way to avoid excesses, but then again, taking “everything in moderation” is in itself excessive. More than “enough” (so go crazy every once in a while). </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to stop every now and again to ask yourself, “What is enough?”  If not, you may never know when you’ve arrived.</p>\n<p><strong>Photo used: </strong><a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/stock-photos/photos/red-wine-in-kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shopify.com</a></p>",
