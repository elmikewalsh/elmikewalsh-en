            "content_html": "<p>It’s 2024 - if you are still using a basic password like <em>password1234</em> (shame on you) or using the same password for all your online accounts, you are just begging for a world of digital (and real-life) hurt.</p>\n<p>It can be a bit intimidating for people to start using a password manager, but put simply: would you prefer to take a bit of time now to set up a small program you can use for free and anywhere, so your passwords are safe, or are you the type that prefers to call banks in a rush to cancel cards, send support emails to companies explaining you were hacked while waiting impatiently for a reply?  If you are the first group - read on!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Choose a free password manager</h3>\n<p>First you need to choose one. There are all sorts of free and paid options, but there are two options that are more than enough for your needs, and both are free:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitwarden</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proton Pass</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The choice is yours - I had access to Bitwarden first so mainly use that. The design is a bit dated. Proton Pass, on the other hand, is much nicer to look at, but not as mature a product as Bitwarden. Anyways, choose one and install. Then, the next step is the most important:</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Create a strong master password</span></h3>\n<p>A good password manager will require you set up a master password, to access the password manager. A good password manager will also NOT store your master password. As a result, should you lose or forget it, you will not be able to retrieve it or request the company send it to you. You also will not be able to generate a new one. So THIS password is one that will have to be a good one and also one that you can remember. (This is the step that will burn you later on if you don’t think about it for just a bit).</p>\n<h3>Import existing passwords</h3>\n<p>If you have passwords saved in your browser, many free password managers allow you to import them. This is a good idea and will save time. Go for it!</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatically store new passwords</span></h3>\n<p>Let the password manager automatically store new passwords when you log in. </p>\n<h3>Create New Passwords</h3>\n<p>Use the Password Manager to manually generate new passwords and also check if your password is found in a data breach. Some password managers, like Bitwarden, will let you easily set a password length (40, 50, even 100 characters). These will be passwords that you are likely unable to ever memorize. However, it isn’t necessary - as long as you remember the master password you set up in step #2, you’ll have access to it.  It also doesn’t matter what browser you use, as there is an extension that you can install and use on your computer, phone, etc.</p>\n<p>Quick easy steps. In 2024 there is no excuse for using a poor password. You can take a small amount of time now to peacefully set up a password manager…. or a lot more (and stressful) time later on.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Photo Used:</strong> <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/security-professional-secret-5199236/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pixabay.com/illustrations/security-professional-secret-5199236/</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Personal branding on the internet can be rather complicated. Especially when you add the factor of a multilanguage website.  Domain name availability, the ability to pronounce / spell a name are all factors.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve put what I believe to be the final touches (for now, at least) on my personal website setup.  Originally, I went with one domain name and a subdomain for English speakers. It looked something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>elmikewalsh.com</li>\n<li>en.elmikewalsh.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all fine and well…. In an English-speaking setting. No one would have problems spelling “mike”, “Walsh” is tough to screw up, and despite “el” being from Spanish, most English speakers would get the idea.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in a Spanish-speaking content, it’s not so easy. Here’s the pitfalls I experienced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mike:</strong>  In Chile at least, you get “Maik”, “Maikol\" or “Mike”.  So there’s a 1 in 3 chance that part will be spelled correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Walsh:</strong> Spanish (and other Romance languages) have a nice flow of consonants and vowels.  My last name does not. So about 100% of the time it is reduced to spelling it out.</li>\n<li><strong>El: </strong>No problems in Spanish land with this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>So, having to spell out m-i-k-e-w-a-l-s-h to share my domain name or email address sucks.  Especially by phone. (Good test for personal branding btw - if you can say it in a phone conversation and the other person can note it, you’re doing well.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s how I got around it:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have two separate domain names  - it’s as short as possible and only the extensions are different.</li>\n<li>For Spanish speakers (and a slight search results boost by using a ccTLD) I can be found at - <a href=\"https://www.elmike.cl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elmike.cl</a></li>\n<li>For the English version of my personal site I went with - elmike.me (you are here)</li>\n<li>For personal email I went with the .me version, since .me works well in Spanish as well.  It’s also easier to say, as “cl” is unpronounceable and you end up saying each letter.</li>\n<li>Also by eliminating my last name, a Spanish-speaker is just left with “mike”.  For the Spanish-speaker (Chilean) that can’t spell it (quite a few it seems) I can say, “Mike. Mee-Kay-con-Ka) and that will work 99% of the time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And for the other 1% electronic communication might be a whole different issue.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The original <a href=\"https://www.elmikewalsh.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elmikewalsh.com</a> domain?  I put together a neat starry night landing/splash page with two photos of myself linked to the Spanish and English versions of my personal sites.</p>\n<p>And that’s all I have to say about that.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Quentin Tarantino recently remarked that he plans to make 10 movies, and that’s it. (note: in context, he did indicate that he would be fine doing something later on despite having done 10 movies, so it’s not a set-in-stone number). Mentioned wanting to go out at the top of his game.  Similar to some, but not all, athletes.  The same applies to everything; our “mere mortal” projects. Our jobs. Our ambitions. Our desire to make more, have more, obtain more, visit more, watch more, see more.</p>\n<p><strong>At what point is it enough?</strong></p>\n<p>Enough means the necessary to meet a need or desire. So once you reach that point, everything beyond that is extra. Unnecessary. Wasteful, even.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the glass half full or half empty?</strong>  <em>(Is that even the correct question?)</em></p>\n<p>There is a strong minimalism trend in a number of circles. You can find excesses in minimalism as well, as many try to do away with everything except the bare spartan essentials of life. In the design world, minimalism appears to mean “Only use black and white please. Hopefully only text.”.  But in some cases, enough means more than black and white.</p>\n<p>There is an old adage to “take everything in moderation”. That is a fine way to avoid excesses, but then again, taking “everything in moderation” is in itself excessive. More than “enough” (so go crazy every once in a while). </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to stop every now and again to ask yourself, “What is enough?”  If not, you may never know when you’ve arrived.</p>\n<p><strong>Photo Used: </strong><a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/stock-photos/photos/red-wine-in-kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.shopify.com/stock-photos/photos/red-wine-in-kitchen</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>On Sunday, December 17, Chile will (again) go to the polls to vote on the new constitution proposal. In very very general political terms, while the first proposal a couple years back was seen as “leftist”, the new one has been prepared by a predominantly right-wing group. It is a simple vote: Do you approve of the new constitution?  Yes or No. Simple question. How hard could it be?</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to fuck it up, if you think about it (which, unfortunately, I have). So, here are 4 ways to fuck up a simple yes/no question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Answer Unprepared:</strong> To vote on a new constitution, you need to read it. You can argue all you want about how it’s long, not everyone has the education level to understand it, etc. If you are reading this, you can read the constitution. Is it long?  Hell, yeah. Over 170 pages.  Is it really interesting?  Not so much.  But considering it is an overreaching document that serves as a sort of national guide for maybe at least 100 years, it might be important.  And considering how much time we spend on phones, on Netflix, on stuff that really isn’t essential to the day-to-day, it’s more irresponsibility or laziness that we don’t bother.  Even if you don’t read it all, at least read some parts. Maybe the ones you feel are the most important.</li>\n<li><strong>Copy Someone Else’s Answer:</strong> Love this one. People all the time complain about how everyone is only interested in themselves and their own well-being; government is only interested in keeping power. But when it comes time to vote yes/no on a constitution, we open it, see how many pages it is, and resort to…. The opinions of other and/or the news. It hurts to think for myself, please think for me. My favorite is when people bitch and moan about how politicians are corrupt, then check to see what their favorite political party is going to vote. Lovely.</li>\n<li><strong>Vote Based On Who Is President:</strong> This one is absurd. A constitution (democratically prepared) is larger than one (or several) administrations. Some people will vote in favor (or against) on Sunday based solely on who is currently president. The current president, by the way, has nothing to do with the new document. It’s a bit like saying, “The football team I hate uses blue uniforms, so I hate football.”</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t Answer The Question:</strong> Annulling your vote for president or senator or what have you is one thing (still think those annulled votes should have some consequence). But this is a document that will be around for a while (if approved) so good to have an opinion. And also, not voting will expose you to a fine.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, we will have to see how this turns out on the weekend. I’m sure there are many other ways to fuck up a simple yes/no question, but you need to start somewhere. And now you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Photo used: </strong><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-is-casting-a-vote-into-a-box-T9CXBZLUvic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-is-casting-a-vote-into-a-box-T9CXBZLUvic</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I remember a past time, a golden time, when this interconnected space called the internet was a different place. It was a place to show who you were, unashamedly. GeoCities and MySpace existed (don’t miss them), Google did not. It was a place to build spaces and pages with primary colors, and behold the hideous ugliness that resulted and say, “I. Made. That.”  And it was created, for no other reason than to make something and maybe – just maybe – someone else would find it.</p>\n<h3>That was then, this is now:</h3>\n<p>The internet has largely transformed itself into the digital equivalent of a mall, where everyone wants to sell you something, or get you to subscribe to the latest trend.  All in all, it’s all the same as the next website, except “it’s our special take on it; subscribe to / buy our XYZ, not the other one”. Every website seems to have a pop-up window, and some try to block what you are looking for. Others are so full of advertisements and banners that you have to search to find what you were really looking for.</p>\n<p>We got smart and installed ad-blockers. The websites, desperate for hits and money, punched back, sometimes forcing us to “disable” the ad blocker, as if what we were doing was….bad. (quick tip: love Safari – when the pop-up does not give you the option to close it, just hit the Reader Mode and it all goes away).   :)</p>\n<p>When we go home (or wherever we live) we close the windows, turn off the lights, and leave the world outside. We then connect to our social media to upload photos of every single waking moment of our life (stopping to actually live that life, in order to better document it). What we are wearing (or not). What we are doing. Where we are doing it. With whom. It’s kinda the equivalent of living in a glass house, taking off all your clothes, taking out a megaphone and announcing to the world that the party is at your place.</p>\n<p><strong>Ewwwww.</strong></p>\n<p>I guess no one will really stop for a moment to actually think about what (and why) we do what we do when we connect. We’re too busy turning off our brains to do what we always do.</p>\n<p>So many people are worried that AI will soon be smarter than humans and we should stop developing that technology. I’d say that humans are in such a rush to stupidify themselves that IA won’t have to overtake us at all – we’ll just dumb ourselves down until AI passes us by naturally.</p>\n<p><strong>Photo used:</strong> <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/christmas-shoping-center-store-1931054/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pixabay.com/photos/christmas-shoping-center-store-1931054/</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In today's world, our virtual existence is like a fortress. Just like castles required fortifications for protection, so does your online presence. It may sound daunting, but don't worry, we've poked around the sage advice from the legendary Sun Tzu, master strategist, to help you strengthen your digital defenses without feeling like you're preparing for war.</p>\n<h3>Know Your Board Game</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, let's look at the importance of knowing the playing field. As Sun Tzu famously said, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the digital realm as understanding your various platforms, being aware of where your sensitive information is stored, and identifying any potential vulnerabilities in your online setup. Where have you set up accounts, what information have you provided, how strong is your password, who has access, etc.</p>\n<p>Defense is not the only factor at play here - being a sly li’l devil is equally important (in a positive sense, of course…usually…). Sun Tzu valued deceit, and the same principle applies in this situation. Be on your guard against deceptive emails attempting to extract your confidential information or entice you to click on dubious links. Adaptability is also crucial. The digital sphere is constantly evolving, so your defenses must evolve as well. Stay ahead by updating security settings, choosing strong passwords (please refrain from 'password123'), installing and using a password manager (<a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitwarden</a> and <a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proton Pass</a> are good), and implementing two-factor authentication for added security.</p>\n<h3>Ninja Up!</h3>\n<p>Don't forget, safeguarding your data is only one piece of the puzzle; safeguarding your identity is just as crucial. Your digital persona warrants just as much caution and protection as your physical self. By delving into Sun Tzu's strategies, you're equipping yourself with the skills of a ninja - swift, elusive to threats, and fortified against any breaches (and ninjas are super cool, of course).</p>\n<p>Armed with timeless wisdom and modern savvy, you'll be able to maneuver through the online realm like a seasoned pro, fortifying your virtual fortress against cyber intruders. It's like becoming your own personal cybersecurity hero without needing a superhero cape, and you can return to wearing your underwear under your pants (cough, cough, Superman, cough).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Photo used:</strong> <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/terracotta-army-china-xian-soldier-1865006/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pixabay.com/photos/terracotta-army-china-xian-soldier-1865006/</a></p>",

            "title": "Privacy: A Primer",
            "content_html": "<p>Privacy is a hot topic in 2023. A concern for some, a buzzword for others. Should I care? What can I do? Is it too late? Why bother?</p>\n<p>I’d love to say this is your one-stop shop for all the answers, but who am I but one set of hands typing? (Disclaimer: In 2023, this website uses ancient technology – I am a human writing this article from scratch; no Artificial Intelligence added).</p>\n<p><strong>But some musings on privacy, for what they may be worth:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Privacy is one of those things that you don’t realize you have (or are losing) until you start to lose it (or no longer have it). Then you value it. And it is by that time too difficult to get it back.</li>\n<li>A completely different topic (Artificial Intelligence) is in large part our willingness to have signed up for and used online storage, free online photos (Google Photos, for example) and any other service offering too-good-to-be-free storage and functionality. Or is it just a coincidence that many of these “free” services used people as the product and then turned to paid plans right before the start of the big AI boom? Who cares about privacy or what can happen – just sign me up for my free photo storage!</li>\n<li>Many consider privacy “too difficult” a topic, requiring work and effort to attend to, and will definitely be interested “later”. I imagine living in a glass house, walking around naked all day, unconcerned that anyone passing by can shoot photos and videos of you now, because later down the road you will invest in curtains and that will just solve the entire problem then and there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what can be done about privacy (online, at least)? Well, this does not at all aim to be a comprehensive primer on protecting yourself online. Just a small list of ideas and possible solutions / services. I’m not affiliated with any of them, and I get nothing by you clicking any links here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email:</strong> Well, it seems like everyone has their Gmail. Sign up, free space. Free photos. Free collaboration. Free, free, free. Until it isn’t. Sign in to any website easy with your Gmail. They can’t read your email. That’s what they say. And you can simply use Google to search for evidence of that. Remember, they are a business, and they have a bottom line. You might consider more private email options such as <a href=\"https://proton.me/mail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ProtonMail</a>, <a href=\"https://skiff.com/mail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skiff Mail</a> or <a href=\"https://postale.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">postale.io</a>. Email (or any service) is only as private as the laws of the country in which the service resides, and it is best to consider the allies / strategic partners of foreign countries (consider searching for things like “Five Eyes” and other related terms. Not on Google. Or in their browser. Go for something private.</li>\n<li><strong>Search:</strong> If you type it into a Google search engine, the world knows it. And don’t fool yourself into thinking that “Private / Incognito” means no one knows. Consider using a search engine that does not track you and your every keystroke, such as <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href=\"https://www.startpage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Startpage</a> (which uses Google results but strips the tracking info).</li>\n<li><strong>Photos:</strong> Google makes money selling advertising. Your information. So the more info they collect on you, the more money they can make. Use any other service. Am I saying that OneDrive or iCloud are private? Hell, no. Does Apple (currently) have a business model of selling advertising to anyone in the universe? No.  So, while it might not be an ideal solution, consider that convenience has a price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most websites will also use Google Analytics to track you, because companies / sites are obsessed with seeing how much traffic they receive.  This website, by the way, has no tracking or analytics installed. I don’t care. There is a method of contact indicated on this website; if you are interested in it, you will find it easily enough.</p>\n<p>Well, those are the musings of the moment. Hope it is of some help to someone!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Photo used:</strong> <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/es/fotos/camaras-de-seguridad-de-varios-colores-LfaN1gswV5c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://unsplash.com/es/fotos/camaras-de-seguridad-de-varios-colores-LfaN1gswV5c</a></p>",
