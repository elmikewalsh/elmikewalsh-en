But what really got my attention, more than the initiative, and even more than the reasons for enacting it, was the way in which he presented it:</p><blockquote><p>This is an experiment.

Let’s take a look at the declarations of each one and then you, dear reader, can try to guess who said which:</p><blockquote><p>“I might be mistaken, because I often am, but I call it as I see it.

Despite his declarations of not wanting to run for reelection, he continues to serve his country as a Senator. He is content with what he has and not what he is lacks; he tends to his garden and trucks around his tiny nation in an old (1987) Volkswagen Beetle.</p><p>So, in this acrid environment, full of controversy, scandal and uncertainty, it is necessary, I think, to pause, take a step back and see things — life included — from a different angle.</p><p>The world is not a place always filled with flowers and optimism, but neither is it perpetually the inverse. And politicians, like all of us, are only human. We don’t — shouldn’t — depend on them to “save the world” because it is tasked to each of us to “save our world”, wherever it is and however small it may be.</p><p>Perhaps there is no better way to part ways than with this gem of a quote from the Last of the Mujicans:</p><blockquote><p>“Despite it all, I believe that the human being that is able not only to improve the world, but also to improve himself.
